"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",John Ferngrove,,How much time do you have?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 11 June 2022,"I've docked a star from this rating because this book is not ideal for busy people who want to quickly learn the language so they can get on with their own projects. To get the best out of this book one would have to download the chapter examples, work through their code, which is much more than is presented in the text, and follow up all the links and references to documentation and dependencies which cover the entirety of the immense Python ecosystem. If I did have the time to follow up on every reference I would probably give the book five stars.
The earlier part of the book deals very well with the core language. People like myself coming to Python from earlier generation languages such as C++, Java, Tcl, etc. can quickly start messing about and muddling along according to familiar paradigms. But the real power of Python only becomes apparent when one understands the advanced data types and language constructs that make Python a genuinely next generation language. The language style that arises from a full understanding of these features is called Pythonic, and to write as such, to write Pythonically. All this makes for compact and highly readable code, of which I thoroughly approve.
As the book progresses however the explanation of the core language becomes increasingly intermixed with aspects of the broader Python ecosystem which are necessarily brief in their treatment and often too brief for the text alone to stand on its own without getting ever more involved in the example code and following up on references to a large array of third party tools and their documentation. The authors seem keen to use the opportunity to cover a career's worth of general observations and best practice heuristics on the whole field of programming more generally. All good stuff, especially for beginners, but off the point for someone wanting to master the language and get on with their own projects. I would estimate that it could take a good few months for the diligent reader to really work through the material not just of the text, but the accompanying sample programs and the documentary references as well.
There's no doubt that a beginner or a computer science student would find this a really solid underpinning to a career both in writing Python and programming more generally. If, like me, you're in a bit of a hurry to get on and apply Python to your own purposes then much of the latter half of the book could feel like a distraction. Perhaps further down the line the areas covered there will tun out to be of relevant interest. How good a reference the book will then make is hard to say. As observed, on many topics the text alone is just too brief to give a confident grounding in the material covered.",I've docked a star from this rating because this book is not ideal for busy people who want to quickly learn the language so they can get on with their own projects.,na,0,na,0,4

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon.

I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django.

I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

Es un buen libro tanto para iniciarse (3 primeros capítulos) como para profundizar en temas más avanzados de CMake. Los tres primeros capítulos abarca lo más básico para comenzar con CMake. Se ve como crear un ejecutable, una librería estática o dinámica, estructuras condicionales, presentación de opciones al usuario, trabajo con librerías de terceros, ...
El 4° capítulo va sobre como trabajar con pruebas unitarias. Me parece muy acertado que hayan incluido ejemplos para google test y boost test. También tiene otro ejemplo con Valgrind para detectar problemas de memoría. Aquí hecho de menos que no se haya incluido también Visual Leak Detector.
Lo que no me convence es que hayan dejado para el capítulo 7 la estructuración de un proyecto CMake. Personalmente creo que es de las primeras cosas que se debería explicar.

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante.","Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake.",statement,0.740825713,POSITIVE,0.996881843,3

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia 🇦🇺 on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers. Suggested further reading tips are very useful and can be found at the end of each chapter. What is missing is a few questions related to developing a solution based on what is learnt in the chapter.

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework.

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Fluff,,Content is briliant. Poor index & contents listings make it very hard to use as a reference. Physical quality of book is dismal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 December 2015,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with.

Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.

Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with.

On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with.

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Fluff,,Content is briliant. Poor index & contents listings make it very hard to use as a reference. Physical quality of book is dismal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 December 2015,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy).

Es un buen libro tanto para iniciarse (3 primeros capítulos) como para profundizar en temas más avanzados de CMake. Los tres primeros capítulos abarca lo más básico para comenzar con CMake. Se ve como crear un ejecutable, una librería estática o dinámica, estructuras condicionales, presentación de opciones al usuario, trabajo con librerías de terceros, ...
El 4° capítulo va sobre como trabajar con pruebas unitarias. Me parece muy acertado que hayan incluido ejemplos para google test y boost test. También tiene otro ejemplo con Valgrind para detectar problemas de memoría. Aquí hecho de menos que no se haya incluido también Visual Leak Detector.
Lo que no me convence es que hayan dejado para el capítulo 7 la estructuración de un proyecto CMake. Personalmente creo que es de las primeras cosas que se debería explicar.

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante.","Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake.",statement,0.990601659,POSITIVE,0.998593509,3

It is really so much more than that. It is a well-structured tutorial and how-to as well. The recipes build on prior recipes. Everything is explained in detail, including concepts and background about CMake. The author provides a ready-made Docker image with all the needed tools pre-installed, and a Git repository with all the book's example code. You can actually edit, build, and run the examples in the Docker image as you are reading the book. This is very helpful. I was up and running the recipes in about 10 minutes (only because I needed to install Docker on my system - otherwise it would have been 2 minutes!).
I am a professional embedded C++ developer who inherited a complex CMake build environment at work, which I need to enhance and modify. I had never been exposed to CMake before. This book is proving to be an extremely valuable resource for me, helping me to understand what I am dealing with and how to modify it.",The author is modest in calling this book a Cookbook.,statement,0.929697335,POSITIVE,0.986819029,5

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia 🇦🇺 on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia 🇦🇺 on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers. Suggested further reading tips are very useful and can be found at the end of each chapter. What is missing is a few questions related to developing a solution based on what is learnt in the chapter.

Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.

1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.

2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.

Mastering Swift 4 - Fourth Edition: An in-depth and comprehensive guide to modern programming techniques with Swift,Bruce D Link,,"Good, somewhat preachy, introduction to programming and designing Swift applications",Reviewed in Canada 🇨🇦 on 26 October 2018,"I came to this book to learn the swift language, with a strong background in Ada, C++, C#, Java (as far as OO languages go).
I find the book a good overview for people wanting to learn the language, rather then wanting to learn just enough to cobble together an iOS or MacOS graphical application.
My main anoyance is that the author confuses OO with single inheritance OO and implicitly assumes OOD is single inheritance OOD. Then Swift prototypes (which much of the rest of the world calls interfaces) become a new wonderful thing.

Here are some examples of typos:
Pg 121, PyMethodDefApi_methods is really PyMethodDef Api_methods. I thought the data type is missing, but couldn't figure out which part is the variable name and which part is the type. This is by no means the only mistake of its kind in this book. There are many, and you must figure out where to insert the spaces to make the codes work. If you're a newbie and want to type along and run the codes as you go, which is pretty much how everyone learns Python from the beginning, you'll spend a lot of time doing this.
The is a part of the book that refers to colored graphs, but this book is black and white. I don't remember which part, but I was disappointed the editor didn't correct that.
If you want to build a C API, Py_InitModule3( ) is no longer supported. (My C compiler flagged it as a warning and I looked it up.) Python 3+ uses PyModuleDef(). This book was published in 2016, but Python 3 came out in 2008.

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Reporting Cookbook,Dave,,Frustrating read right from the start,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 30 June 2017,"The writer references items that do not exist, or leaves out details you need to figure out. They also do not explain the properties they tell you to set do. They just tell you to set them to a particular value. So, I can ""make"" the report, but because they never really explain how the pieces come together, you never really learn anything.
The instructions can be frustrating to follow.
For example on page 23, Creating Multiple Data Regions and Charts In Reports
In step 3, they tell you to select all of the fields and the name data method from the CustTable, but then never explain what the methods do. Just select it.
They then tell you ""How to Do It""
Step 1 tells you to ""Drag the CustTrans dataset to the auto design node. This will create a table design layout"" Trouble is, there is no ""CustTrans"" dataset (and they put it in bold?) There is a dataset, but they never told you what to name it. They should have written ""Drag the dataset you created above to the auto design node...""
Step 3 says, ""Drag the CustGroup field to the Group on node. Also drag the AccountNum field from the dataset to the Group on node"" Problem is, there is no ""Group On"" node to drag anything to. There is a ""Groupings"" node, which you drag the column to. THEN if you expand that, AFTER dragging the column to the Groupings node, you will see the ""Group on"" node.
Step 4 states ""Expand the Group on node and navigate to the Row1 property"" So now the Group On node IS available, however now they call the Row1 node a ""property"" so now im looking over in the properties window.
Sure, you kind of ""figure it out"" but this is the way its supposed to be when someone is teaching you something. This is only the very beginning of the book, so this can make for a long frustrating read.","The writer references items that do not exist, or leaves out details you need to figure out.",statement,0.863827288,POSITIVE,0.997983694,3

Step 4 states ""Expand the Group on node and navigate to the Row1 property"" So now the Group On node IS available, however now they call the Row1 node a ""property"" so now im looking over in the properties window.
Sure, you kind of ""figure it out"" but this is the way its supposed to be when someone is teaching you something. This is only the very beginning of the book, so this can make for a long frustrating read.","This is only the very beginning of the book, so this can make for a long frustrating read.",statement,0.904738009,NEGATIVE,0.99885416,3

Overall this book is a great resource to not just learn Angular but goes deeper and provides more practical usage scenarios.
Chapter 1 is truly a getting started guide, providing basics, Angular fundamentals, insights in to how updates are handled and state maintenance. It is not typical dry getting started as it weaves all this information with ""Guess the Number!"" App.
Chapter 2 covers everything a developer needs to build their first basic App ""7 Minute Workout"", setting up, code organizing, module, bootstrapping, etc. This App makes all the covered concepts interesting and relevant.
Chapter 3 introduces and prepares you for the world of SPA and Routing, this is a precursor to building the next interesting App ""Personal Trainer"" covered in Chapter 4. This App increases the complexity leveraging all the concepts.
Most application needs integration with APIs and this is covered in detail in Chapter 5. There is great amount of wisdom in Chapter 6 learning about Angular Directives, I thoroughly enjoyed this chapter.
Testing is close to my heart, and automation is a key factor for agility and innovation (fear of unknown is great demotivator to any change, lack of automation creates this fear) . Chapter 7 lays great emphasis on testing, make sure to read ""The need for automation"" section intently.
Chapter 8 wraps up this great book with practical scenarios covering performance, authentication & authorization and migrating old AngularJS app.

Most application needs integration with APIs and this is covered in detail in Chapter 5. There is great amount of wisdom in Chapter 6 learning about Angular Directives, I thoroughly enjoyed this chapter.
Testing is close to my heart, and automation is a key factor for agility and innovation (fear of unknown is great demotivator to any change, lack of automation creates this fear) . Chapter 7 lays great emphasis on testing, make sure to read ""The need for automation"" section intently.
Chapter 8 wraps up this great book with practical scenarios covering performance, authentication & authorization and migrating old AngularJS app.

"Angular 6 by Example: Get up and running with Angular by building modern real-world web apps, 3rd Edition",Nisha,,Book Review - Must read for AngularJS Developers,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 7 October 2018,"Disclaimer : One of the author, Chandermani is my good friend but the whole review is unbiased and with perspective of Developer, Architect and Engineering Director.
Overall this book is a great resource to not just learn Angular but goes deeper and provides more practical usage scenarios.
Chapter 1 is truly a getting started guide, providing basics, Angular fundamentals, insights in to how updates are handled and state maintenance. It is not typical dry getting started as it weaves all this information with ""Guess the Number!"" App.

"Angular 6 by Example: Get up and running with Angular by building modern real-world web apps, 3rd Edition",Dude McGnarley,,No exersizes - all cut n paste,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 7 July 2018,"No chapter section exercises. You're cut and pasting everything, which doesn't seem a very effective teaching methodology to me. Alternatively, what one could do is commit the configuration with both Eclipse and IntelliJ setup's and break points. Then you guide the customer through a trace and discuss points of interest like a tour guide. That would be an improvement but I would much rather have the author guiding ME to write code myself so that I encounter my own problems and get to figure them out on my own. Agree that the finished code should be available for students who get stuck, however.
One should assume that the student is a professional operating under pressure. That means they will do the bare minimum necessary to acquire MVP (Minimum Viable Product) . If you don't provide the usual cue's (section and chapter exercises) that it's time to shift from the book to the code, they might get 2, 3, or 4 chapters in and realize they aren't learning anything without grasping exactly why. It's because the lecture / read / exercise methodology is trained by public education and for someone with an extended education, they've internalized this to the point where they don't think about it any more. In a nutshell, software has standards. So does education. They are useful and exist for reasons. What the author might consider is an approach that focuses on getting the student to professional viability and then following up with a companion problem / solution guide for common things new Angular developers experience. These will quickly wind up on Stack Overflow but by the same token you can use Stack Overflow to help write the guide.

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante.","Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake.",statement,0.915383577,NEGATIVE,0.994115591,3

Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante.","Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.",statement,0.987112582,NEGATIVE,0.995836258,3

My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.
I recommend this book to anyone who has attempted, and even partially succeeded at, learning ROS from Google and the wiki but a thorough understanding of the system is still not quite achieved.",I am very impressed with this book.,statement,0.855965555,POSITIVE,0.990278423,5

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers. Suggested further reading tips are very useful and can be found at the end of each chapter. What is missing is a few questions related to developing a solution based on what is learnt in the chapter.
A very good book to read and expand your knowledge. Kudos to the author for the effort that has gone into writing the book.",This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python.,statement,0.95295918,POSITIVE,0.998691738,5

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers. Suggested further reading tips are very useful and can be found at the end of each chapter. What is missing is a few questions related to developing a solution based on what is learnt in the chapter.

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Fluff,,Content is briliant. Poor index & contents listings make it very hard to use as a reference. Physical quality of book is dismal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 December 2015,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.

Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.

1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this.

Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Fluff,,Content is briliant. Poor index & contents listings make it very hard to use as a reference. Physical quality of book is dismal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 December 2015,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this.

Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Ola Klingberg,,Not quite ready for printing yet.,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 12 September 2014,"This book might become worthy of three or ever four stars, once it’s finished, but this sloppily proof-read draft should not have been published. I’m at page 45, and I’m giving up now.
Both the general text and the code examples are so littered with typos and misused words that they are often difficult to make sense of.
The text reads “a single comma” when they mean “single quotes.” It says “The Boolean and contacts” when they mean “Booleans and constants.” The introduction to an example says that it “... creates a form for adding and editing a product” when in fact the example that follows is for a contact form that has nothing to do with any products.
And the code often looks like this:
function index () {
// executed when referring to My_handlercontroller via
URLecho “Hello World”; }

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",John Ferngrove,,How much time do you have?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 11 June 2022,"I've docked a star from this rating because this book is not ideal for busy people who want to quickly learn the language so they can get on with their own projects. To get the best out of this book one would have to download the chapter examples, work through their code, which is much more than is presented in the text, and follow up all the links and references to documentation and dependencies which cover the entirety of the immense Python ecosystem. If I did have the time to follow up on every reference I would probably give the book five stars.
The earlier part of the book deals very well with the core language. People like myself coming to Python from earlier generation languages such as C++, Java, Tcl, etc. can quickly start messing about and muddling along according to familiar paradigms. But the real power of Python only becomes apparent when one understands the advanced data types and language constructs that make Python a genuinely next generation language. The language style that arises from a full understanding of these features is called Pythonic, and to write as such, to write Pythonically. All this makes for compact and highly readable code, of which I thoroughly approve.
As the book progresses however the explanation of the core language becomes increasingly intermixed with aspects of the broader Python ecosystem which are necessarily brief in their treatment and often too brief for the text alone to stand on its own without getting ever more involved in the example code and following up on references to a large array of third party tools and their documentation. The authors seem keen to use the opportunity to cover a career's worth of general observations and best practice heuristics on the whole field of programming more generally. All good stuff, especially for beginners, but off the point for someone wanting to master the language and get on with their own projects. I would estimate that it could take a good few months for the diligent reader to really work through the material not just of the text, but the accompanying sample programs and the documentary references as well.
There's no doubt that a beginner or a computer science student would find this a really solid underpinning to a career both in writing Python and programming more generally. If, like me, you're in a bit of a hurry to get on and apply Python to your own purposes then much of the latter half of the book could feel like a distraction. Perhaps further down the line the areas covered there will tun out to be of relevant interest. How good a reference the book will then make is hard to say.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.

For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text.

Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.

I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again.

I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.

I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again.

I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again.

I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Esteban,,Buen libro sobre CMake,Reviewed in Spain 🇪🇸 on 16 May 2022,"Llevo varios años usando CMake y quería darle un repaso al 'CMake moderno' para limpiar partes obsoletas de mis proyectos así que me decidí por este libro.
Es un buen libro tanto para iniciarse (3 primeros capítulos) como para profundizar en temas más avanzados de CMake. Los tres primeros capítulos abarca lo más básico para comenzar con CMake. Se ve como crear un ejecutable, una librería estática o dinámica, estructuras condicionales, presentación de opciones al usuario, trabajo con librerías de terceros, ...
El 4° capítulo va sobre como trabajar con pruebas unitarias. Me parece muy acertado que hayan incluido ejemplos para google test y boost test. También tiene otro ejemplo con Valgrind para detectar problemas de memoría. Aquí hecho de menos que no se haya incluido también Visual Leak Detector.
Lo que no me convence es que hayan dejado para el capítulo 7 la estructuración de un proyecto CMake. Personalmente creo que es de las primeras cosas que se debería explicar.
Incluye también la instalación, el empaquetado con CPack, documentación con Doxigen y Sphin, CDash.

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante.","Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake.",statement,0.931172609,NEGATIVE,0.999485016,3

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia 🇦🇺 on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.

My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.
I recommend this book to anyone who has attempted, and even partially succeeded at, learning ROS from Google and the wiki but a thorough understanding of the system is still not quite achieved.",It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots.,statement,0.937614143,NEGATIVE,0.976748228,5

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers. Suggested further reading tips are very useful and can be found at the end of each chapter. What is missing is a few questions related to developing a solution based on what is learnt in the chapter.

It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers.

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Fluff,,Content is briliant. Poor index & contents listings make it very hard to use as a reference. Physical quality of book is dismal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 December 2015,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.

3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.

For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",John Ferngrove,,How much time do you have?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 11 June 2022,"I've docked a star from this rating because this book is not ideal for busy people who want to quickly learn the language so they can get on with their own projects. To get the best out of this book one would have to download the chapter examples, work through their code, which is much more than is presented in the text, and follow up all the links and references to documentation and dependencies which cover the entirety of the immense Python ecosystem. If I did have the time to follow up on every reference I would probably give the book five stars.
The earlier part of the book deals very well with the core language. People like myself coming to Python from earlier generation languages such as C++, Java, Tcl, etc. can quickly start messing about and muddling along according to familiar paradigms. But the real power of Python only becomes apparent when one understands the advanced data types and language constructs that make Python a genuinely next generation language. The language style that arises from a full understanding of these features is called Pythonic, and to write as such, to write Pythonically. All this makes for compact and highly readable code, of which I thoroughly approve.
As the book progresses however the explanation of the core language becomes increasingly intermixed with aspects of the broader Python ecosystem which are necessarily brief in their treatment and often too brief for the text alone to stand on its own without getting ever more involved in the example code and following up on references to a large array of third party tools and their documentation. The authors seem keen to use the opportunity to cover a career's worth of general observations and best practice heuristics on the whole field of programming more generally. All good stuff, especially for beginners, but off the point for someone wanting to master the language and get on with their own projects. I would estimate that it could take a good few months for the diligent reader to really work through the material not just of the text, but the accompanying sample programs and the documentary references as well.
There's no doubt that a beginner or a computer science student would find this a really solid underpinning to a career both in writing Python and programming more generally. If, like me, you're in a bit of a hurry to get on and apply Python to your own purposes then much of the latter half of the book could feel like a distraction. Perhaps further down the line the areas covered there will tun out to be of relevant interest. How good a reference the book will then make is hard to say.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon.

I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django.

I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django.

I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Esteban,,Buen libro sobre CMake,Reviewed in Spain 🇪🇸 on 16 May 2022,"Llevo varios años usando CMake y quería darle un repaso al 'CMake moderno' para limpiar partes obsoletas de mis proyectos así que me decidí por este libro.
Es un buen libro tanto para iniciarse (3 primeros capítulos) como para profundizar en temas más avanzados de CMake. Los tres primeros capítulos abarca lo más básico para comenzar con CMake. Se ve como crear un ejecutable, una librería estática o dinámica, estructuras condicionales, presentación de opciones al usuario, trabajo con librerías de terceros, ...
El 4° capítulo va sobre como trabajar con pruebas unitarias. Me parece muy acertado que hayan incluido ejemplos para google test y boost test. También tiene otro ejemplo con Valgrind para detectar problemas de memoría. Aquí hecho de menos que no se haya incluido también Visual Leak Detector.
Lo que no me convence es que hayan dejado para el capítulo 7 la estructuración de un proyecto CMake. Personalmente creo que es de las primeras cosas que se debería explicar.

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante.","Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake.",statement,0.490545869,POSITIVE,0.998902917,3

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia 🇦🇺 on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.
