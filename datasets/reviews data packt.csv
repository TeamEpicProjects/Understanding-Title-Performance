Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Mohd Azam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended,Reviewed in India on 25 May 2022,This is best book for advance NLP tasks. BERT is not more complex … recommended for NLP developers
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,MRS IYENGAR,5.0 out of 5 stars,A pitch-perfect book in regards to getting started with BERT in NLP.,Reviewed in India on 7 March 2021,"The amount of in-depth information compiled about BERT and its varients in this book is quite astonishing. The content is top-notch with great visual explanations. Encoders and decoders are very hard to explain. In this book encoder and decoder chapters are peaches, they are explained with absolute perfection. The range of BERT variants in this book is mind-blowing, the book contains BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, TInyBERT, BERTSUM, etc. My favorite BERT models are XLM-R, Sentence BERT, and VideoBERT. The author explains each and every concept with ease. I personally felt very happy to have purchased and read the book. I thank the author for writing such a gem of a book. If you looking for a book to strengthen your knowledge of NLP, Deep Learning, BERT this is the go-to book. Hope my suggestion helps."

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,ani,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome book for learning BERT,Reviewed in India on 5 February 2021,"The book explains transformers and BERT in very detail. I’m awestruck with the way the author have explained the concepts in a seamlessly simple way possible. I really loved the narrative style of the book.
I can’t believe someone explained BERT with so much of in-depth detail. The book covers lot of things which I was never aware of and many different types of BERT like tinyBERT, ELECTRA, Multilingual BERT, XLM-R, and many others. If you are not getting this then definitely you are missing out a greatest content on BERT ever."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Mohamed Rizwan,3.0 out of 5 stars,Price too high,Reviewed in India on 4 July 2021,Description are very well written but code implementation is ambiguous. Too much price of the book

Finally, this book provides an in-depth and detailed info about BERT."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very very bad quality printing,Reviewed in India on 6 July 2021,Very bad quality printing! At such a high price printing quality was supposed to be excellent but it is worse than even news paper printing. So much so that sometimes it is causing readability issues.

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Jose,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not clear.,Reviewed in Germany on 16 August 2021,"It is the first time ever I write a review in amazon, but I could not satand this. The pic shows very UNCLEAR explanation of mathematical operations. What kind of operation is shown in fig. 1.18? There are other examples like this one. I understand that pack books are not reviewed at all but this is basic presentation stuff. I expect from a book to save me time for learning. If I habe to figure out myself half of the math then I might be as better off reading some blogs online. Besides the maths there is not enough logical explanation order. It really seems that someone who really knows a lot drops some basic points but totally forgetting that he is talking (writing) to someone who knows zero about transformers."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,駒井 雄一郎,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's like a student's report. It's no longer a primer but a catalogue of shallow knowledge.,Reviewed in Japan on 2 June 2022,"I was disappointed by the content. Huge number of typo, poor printing quality and above all, silly and floppy explanation. I couldn't understand what the author try to deliver to the readers.
I hope this crap will be sunk in the bottom of the search result."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,ML engineer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too superficial explanations,Reviewed in the United States on 4 October 2021,"Pro: The book does add a little bit of details and explanations beyond what is written in the research papers (e.g. 'Attention is all you need', 'BERT -...'). In that regard, it is not completely worthless.
Contra: However, it stays too much on the surface. It repeats itself very often (i.e. the same sentence is repeated maybe 5-10 times inside one chapter, perhaps with a non-essential reordering of the sub-sentences). There would have been many opportunities to dig deeper or provide more understanding, besides what is already written in the research papers. But the book does not do this, by and large.
So, I am back to trying to study BERT deeper using tutorials and blog posts on the internet, which are typically not satisfactory, but provide a little bit more understanding and context into understanding BERT."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Dwayne Phillips,2.0 out of 5 stars,They tried....but failed,Reviewed in the United States on 26 February 2022,"I gave two stars instead of one star for effort.
(1) I bought a copy in the fall of 2021. There were printing problems with subscripts and superscripts that made the text unreadable. In addition, some of the text in the figures was tiny. I wrote the publisher and they worked with me and eventually sent me a copy of the book with the printing improved.
(2) I tried and tried and tried to get through the first 20 pages of the book. It needs to be edited and rewritten. There are basic grammar and English mistakes in every paragraph. Perhaps the writing team does not write in English as a native language. Well, that is why publishers have editors. Well, they didn't edit this book.
(3) Good effort, they tried, but they failed."

"Mastering Machine Learning with R -: Advanced prediction, algorithms, and learning methods with R 3.x",Jose Luis,1.0 out of 5 stars,Achtung! Book is full of erratas,Reviewed in Germany on 5 October 2017,"Sometimes, the code in the book doesn't work (R shows error messages and stop running the code) because the data doesn't meet the function requirements.
Charts are duplicated / missed what makes not possible to follow the examples properly.
This book can be used to get notions about the process but not not master ML with R unless you have R and stats knowledge that enables you to rewrite some code.
I have been sending the erratas to the publisher without any respond so far."

SQL for Data Analytics - Third Edition: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data,KenO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic introduction to sql & data analytics,Reviewed in the United States on 15 September 2022,"This book does a great job of introducing SQL topics in a way that is intuitive and easily understood while not being frustrating in its simplicity.
I'm very new to using SQL and was stumbling through learning joins & aggregate functions when I was given the opportunity to review a pre-release copy of this book & I've gotta say that I'm unbelievably grateful for that.
Instead of struggling to make it through questionably worded online references, I have been guided through well written & intelligently motivated instruction & examples. I've learned a great deal from this book so far & I'm only about 6 chapters in.
If you're just getting started in the world of SQL, ""SQL for Data Analytics"" is an excellent guide.
Working my way through the book has given me a solid understanding of the content & has enabled me to expand beyond the examples provided & build useful queries that are already proving their worth to my team.
Highly recommended."
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,Reviewed in India on 29 October 2017,Useless
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,alex3410,2.0 out of 5 stars,Info looks good but layout is poor,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2018,"First impressions are the information is good but the formatting is really really poor - code sections have not been formatted for print so lines run on to multiple lines making it hard to read
No spacing between sections of code also make it hard to read with it all forming huge blocks of text
Finally you are presented with complete code samples explained with comments within the code rather then separate sections - these comments are not immediately obvious & again run over causing confusion as to if the text is part of the comment or code
It’s annoying because the topics complex enough as it is without struggling with poor layout
Update : finished the book, poor formatting continues throughout & makes it harder to understand the examples, writing in places is poor which again makes it harder to understand.
That being said it’s got useful information in there & worth reading if only because the number of books on CI development are slim"
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Dean Barker,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't bother on Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2014,The php code is not formatted correctly and is very difficult to follow. New lines are not new lines and the comments merge with the actual code in one big messy block. Never buying another tech book from Kindle again. Would get a refund if its possible but its been too ling since I bought.
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Ola Klingberg,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite ready for printing yet.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 September 2014,"This book might become worthy of three or ever four stars, once it’s finished, but this sloppily proof-read draft should not have been published. I’m at page 45, and I’m giving up now.
Both the general text and the code examples are so littered with typos and misused words that they are often difficult to make sense of.
The text reads “a single comma” when they mean “single quotes.” It says “The Boolean and contacts” when they mean “Booleans and constants.” The introduction to an example says that it “... creates a form for adding and editing a product” when in fact the example that follows is for a contact form that has nothing to do with any products.
And the code often looks like this:
function index () {
// executed when referring to My_handlercontroller via
URLecho “Hello World”; }
You have to look at that for a minute to figure out what is code and what is comment, since the lines have been muddled together.
I’m thinking about requesting a refund, even though I’ve made some highlighting. This book was simply not ready to be sent to the printer."
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Eric D. Brown,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not much ""new"" here",Reviewed in the United States on 4 March 2014,I took a chance on this book and I'm not that happy that I did. This book provides very little in the way of 'new' examples and definitely stays away from any in-depth discussions of CodeIgniter. There's nothing in this book that you can't find on the CI website.
Mastering Bootstrap 4,Jesus S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Muy buen libro,Reviewed in Mexico on 11 December 2017,"Me gusto mucho como esta distribuido, como maneja los conceptos pero sobre todo como te lleva de la mano para comenzar a programar en estos lenguajes."
Mastering Bootstrap 4,Cecillac,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it for anyone who ca read online documentation,Reviewed in the United States on 13 December 2019,I 2as hoping for the inside track not the documentation represented. Nothing on how to create your own themes. Gave it away.
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",John Ferngrove,4.0 out of 5 stars,How much time do you have?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2022,"I've docked a star from this rating because this book is not ideal for busy people who want to quickly learn the language so they can get on with their own projects. To get the best out of this book one would have to download the chapter examples, work through their code, which is much more than is presented in the text, and follow up all the links and references to documentation and dependencies which cover the entirety of the immense Python ecosystem. If I did have the time to follow up on every reference I would probably give the book five stars.
The earlier part of the book deals very well with the core language. People like myself coming to Python from earlier generation languages such as C++, Java, Tcl, etc. can quickly start messing about and muddling along according to familiar paradigms. But the real power of Python only becomes apparent when one understands the advanced data types and language constructs that make Python a genuinely next generation language. The language style that arises from a full understanding of these features is called Pythonic, and to write as such, to write Pythonically. All this makes for compact and highly readable code, of which I thoroughly approve.
As the book progresses however the explanation of the core language becomes increasingly intermixed with aspects of the broader Python ecosystem which are necessarily brief in their treatment and often too brief for the text alone to stand on its own without getting ever more involved in the example code and following up on references to a large array of third party tools and their documentation. The authors seem keen to use the opportunity to cover a career's worth of general observations and best practice heuristics on the whole field of programming more generally. All good stuff, especially for beginners, but off the point for someone wanting to master the language and get on with their own projects. I would estimate that it could take a good few months for the diligent reader to really work through the material not just of the text, but the accompanying sample programs and the documentary references as well.
There's no doubt that a beginner or a computer science student would find this a really solid underpinning to a career both in writing Python and programming more generally. If, like me, you're in a bit of a hurry to get on and apply Python to your own purposes then much of the latter half of the book could feel like a distraction. Perhaps further down the line the areas covered there will tun out to be of relevant interest. How good a reference the book will then make is hard to say. As observed, on many topics the text alone is just too brief to give a confident grounding in the material covered."
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Danilo M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Like this book as begginer,Reviewed in Germany on 5 January 2022,"Learn Python programming, for begginers and advanced users."
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.
Fairly satisfied with this book and happy with/grateful for the foundation that’s it’s helped me lay so far!"
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Areohbe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great if you have some prior computer science knowledge and math skills,Reviewed in the United States on 18 April 2022,"This book is great! Not the most thorough but covers all the bases none the less. As the description states it is preferable to have some experience with computer science. I think anyone could pick up think book and learn SOME python. However, there are some parts that someone with no knowledge will likely struggle and will need outside support."

"Artificial Intelligence By Example: Acquire advanced AI, machine learning, and deep learning design skills, 2nd Edition",michael mejia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps bridge many gaps other books fall short of doing,Reviewed in the United States on 21 March 2020,"Too many books are only math oriented and miss the implementation of using such algorithms in programming languages. Other books focus on programming the concepts but don't go in depth on the math behind it. From start to finish this book gives you both worlds. No longer do i have this black mystery box mentality of implementing an algorithm(using a library) knowing how to use it but have no idea how it works behind the scenes. This book combines a mathematician, developer, and has Business logic. I Would highly recommend this book."

"Mastering Tableau 2021: Implement advanced business intelligence techniques and analytics with Tableau, 3rd Edition",Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Riddled with errors...so far.. but fixed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2021,"Update: Excellent support from Publisher who has fixed the online Tableau and will update text for next edition. Upgraded to 3 star for now. Will revisit once book finished.
I'm currently working through this book and have completed chapter 1. I'm seriously doubting continuing with further chapters due to fundamental issues with some of the material.
1. Page 37 the material uses a work alongside example to use a Measure called Quantity. The measure called Quantity does not exist.
2. Page 9, it advises to navigate to the Nested Sorting tab. Unfortunately this tab doesnt exist.
To find two huge glaring errors in the first ten or so worked examples in what is a recap chapter of basic Tableau concepts is disconcerting on a THIRD edition of a book, and makes me doubt whether it is worth continuing with the rest of the book.
I may continue and if I get to the end and not find any further issues I may revisit this review."

Tableau is a tool - and over time popular tools will change. However, skills retain their usefulness. Aside from learning the Tableau toolset, the other reason I am interested in this book is to sharpen skills key to data science - coding, math and stats. For me, this is a practical approach - the book has loads of example solutions that I can refer to whilst problem solving."
"Mastering Tableau 2021: Implement advanced business intelligence techniques and analytics with Tableau, 3rd Edition",Julius Giron,5.0 out of 5 stars,Expert level business intelligence and visualization!,Reviewed in the United States on 26 August 2021,"If you are looking to up your analysis and visualization game using Tableau, this is the book for you! As a business analytics professional, I look for books that can distill complex subjects in a way that everyone can benefit from. This book does that. This book not only covers the essential functions of Tableau Software, but it also discusses advanced functionalities like expert-level examples to help with visual design, time series analysis, and geo-spatial analysis and connecting Tableau to Python and R.
Tableau is becoming more robust and flexible, allowing you now to connect Amazon Web Services (AWS)' SageMaker machine learning models to Tableau workbooks, continuing its evolution to being a complete data science platform. To better leverage Tableau, read the book."
"Mastering Tableau 2021: Implement advanced business intelligence techniques and analytics with Tableau, 3rd Edition",Native Commissioner,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle version: Navigation and Table of Contents not numbered meaningfully,Reviewed in the United States on 27 March 2022,"It's difficult to see which chapter you are reading, which also makes narrowing down a search to relevant content unnecessarily convoluted. All they had to do was number the chapters visibly on the navigation. Readers are not necessarily always trying to read the entire book in sequence, publisher should make navigation efficient. Otherwise it's a pretty good intro book, but yikes you waste a lot of time just trying to narrow down a search to relevant content."
Mastering Microsoft Power Bi: Expert techniques for effective data analytics and business intelligence,gg,4.0 out of 5 stars,good book to understand on all areas of Power BI,Reviewed in India on 20 November 2018,book gives very good scenario's on all areas of power BI.

Mastering Microsoft Power Bi: Expert techniques for effective data analytics and business intelligence,A G.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very poorly written and difficult to follow,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 June 2019,"Looking at the Table of Contents this appears to be a comprehensive book to help with the setting up and administering of Microsoft PowerBI. However, The content itself is very difficult to follow and key explanations of 'why' are missing. It fails to explain why one technique would be better used than another. X does this, Y does that, but not which to use and when.
It also bounces around with Chapter 1 referencing Chapter 2, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. This makes it even harder to understand.
Terms are constantly introduced with no explanation, to be frank its more lite a novel than an educational or instructive book."
Mastering Microsoft Power Bi: Expert techniques for effective data analytics and business intelligence,Gerry,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2019,This book might have some good content but I think its terrible because you cannot follow the examples given. This is because the actual database used to create all the examples shown is a modified version of the Adventure Works DW. I see no reason why this not provided in the code files. Its fine if you just want to read it as a novel but i prefer to get my hands dirty.

Apache Spark Quick Start Guide: Quickly learn the art of writing efficient big data applications with Apache Spark,Ulysses,3.0 out of 5 stars,"some useful material, but sloppy writing and editing",Reviewed in the United States on 2 May 2019,"I basically got what I wanted, which was a quick overview, with an intro to key concepts. Also some of the details addressed questions I had. I scouted a bunch of other books first, and it was the table-of-contents that sold me on this one.
The problem is that this feels like a first draft that nobody bothered to read through. I doubt that it's an exaggeration to say that the average page has a dozen glaring syntax problems that could easily have been fixed. The figures are often poorly labelled, or even poorly conceived. There are extra or missing words. It might be that I actually learned a little more than I would have otherwise, because at a few places I had to decipher some garbled text to work out what the authors must have meant, whereas cleaned-up text might've gone in one ear and out the other.
The concepts are accessible. The scope seems thorough, for a quick introduction. It's not so bad that you can't breeze your way through it, but it feels like a hasty job slapped into print without any supervision."

Django 4 By Example - Fourth Edition: Build powerful and reliable Python web applications from scratch,Mae,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended for Python programmers,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 September 2022,"This book is the most practical resource to learn Django. The book teaches you Django by building 4 complete projects that include integration with other technologies like Redis, Celery, Memcached and multiple Python libraries and third-party Django applications.
This book does the best job covering the basics of Django and much more than that. The book is easy to follow but assumes you some basic Python and web development knowledge (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I love the examples to create a recommendation engine, a Facebook-like user activity feed and real-time async chat application using channels."

"Practical Web Penetration Testing: Secure web applications using Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, and more",D. Garland,1.0 out of 5 stars,A compilation of free information and requiring licensed software to follow,Reviewed in the United States on 5 March 2020,"For those who want a TL:DR - waste of money, filled with information that can be found freely on the internet, provides tutorials on licensed ($400 USD) Burp Suite (not the free version), the last 15% of the book is nothing but cheat sheets for common pen-testing tools (again, free on the internet).
Most of the work is a compilation of information that can be freely found using any search engine. I bought this primarily as a beginners introduction to pen-testing websites using Burp Suite. Obviously, the author has a licensed version of Burp Suite and if you want to follow along with the book you'll need to shell out $400 for a Burp Suite license. Otherwise, you aren't going to get much out of that section.
There a few examples of how to exploit the OWASP Mutillidae website that the book has you setup. Again, information you can get for free on the internet and even directly from the Mutillidae website itself."
"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Esteban,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buen libro sobre CMake,Reviewed in Spain on 16 May 2022,"Llevo varios años usando CMake y quería darle un repaso al 'CMake moderno' para limpiar partes obsoletas de mis proyectos así que me decidí por este libro.
Es un buen libro tanto para iniciarse (3 primeros capítulos) como para profundizar en temas más avanzados de CMake. Los tres primeros capítulos abarca lo más básico para comenzar con CMake. Se ve como crear un ejecutable, una librería estática o dinámica, estructuras condicionales, presentación de opciones al usuario, trabajo con librerías de terceros, ...
El 4° capítulo va sobre como trabajar con pruebas unitarias. Me parece muy acertado que hayan incluido ejemplos para google test y boost test. También tiene otro ejemplo con Valgrind para detectar problemas de memoría. Aquí hecho de menos que no se haya incluido también Visual Leak Detector.
Lo que no me convence es que hayan dejado para el capítulo 7 la estructuración de un proyecto CMake. Personalmente creo que es de las primeras cosas que se debería explicar.
Incluye también la instalación, el empaquetado con CPack, documentación con Doxigen y Sphin, CDash.
Otro acierto del libro es utilizar en los ejemplos librerías como OpenMP, Eigen, Blas, Lapack o Boost.
Todos los ejemplos están en GitHub lo cual es de agradecer."
"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante."
"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Thierry B.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Moui,Reviewed in France on 29 August 2019,"Il n'y a pas beaucoup d'ouvrages sur CMake, et la plupart se contentent d'imprimer le manuel.
Celui-là n'a pas de grandes qualités pédagogiques et manque pas mal de recul: études de cas concrets, mais pas forcément facile de trouver des infos précises sans tout dépiauter.
Mais au moins il amène de l'info sur l'usage moderne de CMake, et reste abordable et bien écrit."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",David C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jam packed with useful information about CMake,Reviewed in the United States on 7 September 2020,"The author is modest in calling this book a Cookbook. It is really so much more than that. It is a well-structured tutorial and how-to as well. The recipes build on prior recipes. Everything is explained in detail, including concepts and background about CMake. The author provides a ready-made Docker image with all the needed tools pre-installed, and a Git repository with all the book's example code. You can actually edit, build, and run the examples in the Docker image as you are reading the book. This is very helpful. I was up and running the recipes in about 10 minutes (only because I needed to install Docker on my system - otherwise it would have been 2 minutes!).
I am a professional embedded C++ developer who inherited a complex CMake build environment at work, which I need to enhance and modify. I had never been exposed to CMake before. This book is proving to be an extremely valuable resource for me, helping me to understand what I am dealing with and how to modify it."

"Mastering Microsoft Endpoint Manager: Deploy and manage Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows 365 on both physical and cloud PCs",Ben Whitmore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Insights on every page - truly a masterpiece,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 October 2021,"This book stands in a class of its own. Never before has a comprehensive, detailed book been put together to help you on your MEM journey. There have been other great MEM books, don't get me wrong, but the attention to detail and concepts in this book are incredible.
Every page is brimming with knowledge. The Index makes it really easy to jump straight to your topics of interest. Want to start using Autopilot but never touched it before? This book is for you. Don't fully understand all the application delivery options available in MEM? This book is for you.
Christiaan and Per have decades of experience between them and that culmination of knowledge comes together in this great book. Look at the thickness of the book in one of the photos - you really are getting bang for your buck.
Very easy to read, very clear guided steps to configure every inch of your MEM tenant. Great stuff!"

The book itself is good and complete, however the Kindle version is not only missing large sections which are in the book, but there are also pages and sections completely mixed up and out of order. The Kindle version should be pulled off the market and re-edited. Otherwise the book itself is full of up to date information on Burp Suite."

Python Algorithmic Trading Cookbook: All the recipes you need to implement your own algorithmic trading strategies in Python,Mahormi M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,A better book to learn stock trading using python,Reviewed in India on 23 October 2020,"The book gives easy methodology to work with financial data and algorithmic trading using python. Working with stock trading and finance data requires deep statistics to find trends and predict stock prices. This book serves a good blend of statistics and machine learning using python. In the first chapter, the book gives a detail idea of python basic but focuses on how to work with timeseries data, especially with python Datetime. Most python cookbooks omits this important segment of manipulating timeseries data which is not the case here. After covering the basic of python in chapter one, the book dives deep into the working of financial data from chapter 2 onwards. Chapter 2 shows the basics of stock trading and modules to be used in algorithmic trading. From chapter 3 to chapter 7, the book focused on how to fetch various types of financial data, ways to process the data and plot the data for better visualisation and to find trends. From chapter 8 onwards, the book digs deep into the domain of financial analysis. The book also covers step by step process (with code) for Algorithmic trading strategies (Paper trading and Real trading) which are absent in most of the similar books. Some parts of the book were bit difficult for me to grasp as I do not possess knowledge in finance domain. But this book provides a complete package for those who wants to learn how to work with financial data provided they have some prior knowledge in finance, stock market and basic python."
Python Algorithmic Trading Cookbook: All the recipes you need to implement your own algorithmic trading strategies in Python,janath jsk,5.0 out of 5 stars,best book for algorithmic trading,Reviewed in India on 7 October 2020,"This book is useful for user with some experience in python and algorithms that in interested in stock markets and trading algorithms. It gives experience through step by step processes of learning the topic in fetching the data, computing data, plotting data, how algorithms are designed to automate the trading and some basic about stock market working. After reading this book you can able to design your own algorithm trading.
What I like in this book:
Every topic in this book explained in detailed and depth both how to do it and how it works. The first chapter starts from basic about modules that used in algorithm trading. The second chapter is very basis and rest of the book is based on.
Chapter 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 shows how to compute, fetch and plotting data.
From chapter 8 the book is more realistic and intersecting it shows how to combine the things that you already learned in this book and clearly explain the classes are interact with each other. In chapter 9 detailed and step by step process about evaluating the performance of algorithmic trading.
In finale chapter explain the paper trading method for analyze the risk, I like this chapter very much because of executing the trading in live market hours.
What I Do not like in this book:
Some easily understood topics such as time modules also explained in step by step process, this bored me. If you already know the topic you can gently skip it, else you need to read it to understand the rest of the topics.
The finale chapter only shows paper trading (virtual trading) implementation and does not show the real trading implementations. However, paper trading almost similar to real trading.
What I would like to see:
There is no exercise given at the end of each chapter. If exercise given at the end of chapters, it is very help full for all reader.
I like the summaries at the start of the chapter what we going to learn. The same way the author can give the summaries with short explanations for quick review at the end of the chapters, if these things are added to this book. It became excellent book for algorithmic trading.
I really liked the way topics are explained in this book, step by step process of learning is really excellent idea, but some of the things I mentioned above bothering me."
Python Algorithmic Trading Cookbook: All the recipes you need to implement your own algorithmic trading strategies in Python,Karl Bateman,5.0 out of 5 stars,10-Oct,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2020,"Great book! I'm fairly new to python, and I am able to follow the book with ease."
Python Algorithmic Trading Cookbook: All the recipes you need to implement your own algorithmic trading strategies in Python,Robin T. Wernick,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comprehensive Equity Order Entry, RESULT Plotting Python coded Application Approach",Reviewed in the United States on 12 November 2020,"If you just want a Python approach to order entry and investment result plotting program, then this book will satisfy even the severest critic. It begins with a reliance on the Jupyter Notebook to process the various data objects and progresses to showing how to address the Broker Interface.
The next step is to show how to do both step and candle plotting.
Finally there are several chapters on submitting various types of Broker requests and evaluating the response from the Broker's API.
This is NOT a book on finding and selecting investment entities. Nor is it a book that will show you how to predict buy/sell operations. For that you will have to order Hands-On Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading and/or Learn Algorithmic Trading."
Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Antony Vilson,2.0 out of 5 stars,This book is highly overpriced for its contents.,Reviewed in India on 13 June 2022,"It covers many things but none in detail except a few.

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Anand pL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Books for Learning Python Beginner to Advanced level,Reviewed in India on 29 December 2021,"This book is an industry-level book that will help you to develop the coding skills in Python that can be used for tackling complex real-world problems that will help you to perform Automation in difficult use cases.
In this book, you’ll build on that foundational knowledge to learn how to leverage tools, libraries, and best practices to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code.
This book explains the tricks and traps that turn a few lines of Python code into much more than expected, which often leads to bugs and crashes if not written or understood correctly.
It also covers techniques for catching performance issues before they occur and debugging code efficiently when problems arise.
The content of this book is culled from code examples provided by experienced Python programmers who have encountered the same problems that you will encounter and deal with them effectively."
Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers. Suggested further reading tips are very useful and can be found at the end of each chapter. What is missing is a few questions related to developing a solution based on what is learnt in the chapter.
A very good book to read and expand your knowledge. Kudos to the author for the effort that has gone into writing the book."

Being an Electronics Graduate, I found the contents of the book extremely simple to understand and comprehend. It doesn't matter if you are not an Computer science student. The concepts of this book are extremely simple.
It covers a wide range of topics in cryptography . But some parts can have more explanations . This is not the same as the original 900+ book by Stallings . Suggested for all those who are new to cryptographt . But if you look from programming poin tof view , this book may not be sufficient . For some parts I had to refer Internet particularly regarding Elliptic Curve Cryptography , Dynamic S box etc."

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Fluff,3.0 out of 5 stars,Content is briliant. Poor index & contents listings make it very hard to use as a reference. Physical quality of book is dismal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 December 2015,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.
Note: My comments refer to Pearson New International Edition - 3rd edition ISBN-10: 1292024208, ISBN-13: 978-1292024202."
Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Ben Tristem,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Edition 3 is broken,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2018,"Kindle Edition has serious issues where it renders mathematical symbols such as x and y as a tiny dot.

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,KENNETH MORE,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. ...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2017,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. Also it refers to pages that do not contain information it claims to have. For example on page 245 it refers me to page 1066 for BNF. However if you go to page 1066 you find Bibliography. So I believe the book is incomplete as Appendixes are not included.

The content is top-notch with great visual explanations. Encoders and decoders are very hard to explain. In this book encoder and decoder chapters are peaches, they are explained with absolute perfection. The range of BERT variants in this book is mind-blowing, the book contains BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, TInyBERT, BERTSUM, etc. My favorite BERT models are XLM-R, Sentence BERT, and VideoBERT. The author explains each and every concept with ease. I personally felt very happy to have purchased and read the book. I thank the author for writing such a gem of a book. If you looking for a book to strengthen your knowledge of NLP, Deep Learning, BERT this is the go-to book. Hope my suggestion helps."

The pic shows very UNCLEAR explanation of mathematical operations. What kind of operation is shown in fig. 1.18? There are other examples like this one. I understand that pack books are not reviewed at all but this is basic presentation stuff. I expect from a book to save me time for learning. If I habe to figure out myself half of the math then I might be as better off reading some blogs online. Besides the maths there is not enough logical explanation order. It really seems that someone who really knows a lot drops some basic points but totally forgetting that he is talking (writing) to someone who knows zero about transformers."

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,ML engineer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too superficial explanations,Reviewed in the United States on 4 October 2021,"Pro: The book does add a little bit of details and explanations beyond what is written in the research papers (e.g. 'Attention is all you need', 'BERT -...'). In that regard, it is not completely worthless.
Contra: However, it stays too much on the surface. It repeats itself very often (i.e. the same sentence is repeated maybe 5-10 times inside one chapter, perhaps with a non-essential reordering of the sub-sentences). There would have been many opportunities to dig deeper or provide more understanding, besides what is already written in the research papers. But the book does not do this, by and large.
So, I am back to trying to study BERT deeper using tutorials and blog posts on the internet, which are typically not satisfactory, but provide a little bit more understanding and context into understanding BERT."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Dwayne Phillips,2.0 out of 5 stars,They tried....but failed,Reviewed in the United States on 26 February 2022,"I gave two stars instead of one star for effort.
(1) I bought a copy in the fall of 2021. There were printing problems with subscripts and superscripts that made the text unreadable. In addition, some of the text in the figures was tiny. I wrote the publisher and they worked with me and eventually sent me a copy of the book with the printing improved.
(2) I tried and tried and tried to get through the first 20 pages of the book. It needs to be edited and rewritten. There are basic grammar and English mistakes in every paragraph. Perhaps the writing team does not write in English as a native language. Well, that is why publishers have editors. Well, they didn't edit this book.
(3) Good effort, they tried, but they failed."

SQL for Data Analytics - Third Edition: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data,KenO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic introduction to sql & data analytics,Reviewed in the United States on 15 September 2022,"This book does a great job of introducing SQL topics in a way that is intuitive and easily understood while not being frustrating in its simplicity.
I'm very new to using SQL and was stumbling through learning joins & aggregate functions when I was given the opportunity to review a pre-release copy of this book & I've gotta say that I'm unbelievably grateful for that.
Instead of struggling to make it through questionably worded online references, I have been guided through well written & intelligently motivated instruction & examples. I've learned a great deal from this book so far & I'm only about 6 chapters in.
If you're just getting started in the world of SQL, ""SQL for Data Analytics"" is an excellent guide.
Working my way through the book has given me a solid understanding of the content & has enabled me to expand beyond the examples provided & build useful queries that are already proving their worth to my team.
Highly recommended."

Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,alex3410,2.0 out of 5 stars,Info looks good but layout is poor,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2018,"First impressions are the information is good but the formatting is really really poor - code sections have not been formatted for print so lines run on to multiple lines making it hard to read
No spacing between sections of code also make it hard to read with it all forming huge blocks of text
Finally you are presented with complete code samples explained with comments within the code rather then separate sections - these comments are not immediately obvious & again run over causing confusion as to if the text is part of the comment or code
It’s annoying because the topics complex enough as it is without struggling with poor layout
Update : finished the book, poor formatting continues throughout & makes it harder to understand the examples, writing in places is poor which again makes it harder to understand.
That being said it’s got useful information in there & worth reading if only because the number of books on CI development are slim"

Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Ola Klingberg,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite ready for printing yet.,Reviewed in the United States on 12 September 2014,"This book might become worthy of three or ever four stars, once it’s finished, but this sloppily proof-read draft should not have been published. I’m at page 45, and I’m giving up now.
Both the general text and the code examples are so littered with typos and misused words that they are often difficult to make sense of.
The text reads “a single comma” when they mean “single quotes.” It says “The Boolean and contacts” when they mean “Booleans and constants.” The introduction to an example says that it “... creates a form for adding and editing a product” when in fact the example that follows is for a contact form that has nothing to do with any products.
And the code often looks like this:
function index () {
// executed when referring to My_handlercontroller via
URLecho “Hello World”; }
You have to look at that for a minute to figure out what is code and what is comment, since the lines have been muddled together.
I’m thinking about requesting a refund, even though I’ve made some highlighting. This book was simply not ready to be sent to the printer."

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",John Ferngrove,4.0 out of 5 stars,How much time do you have?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2022,"I've docked a star from this rating because this book is not ideal for busy people who want to quickly learn the language so they can get on with their own projects. To get the best out of this book one would have to download the chapter examples, work through their code, which is much more than is presented in the text, and follow up all the links and references to documentation and dependencies which cover the entirety of the immense Python ecosystem. If I did have the time to follow up on every reference I would probably give the book five stars.
The earlier part of the book deals very well with the core language. People like myself coming to Python from earlier generation languages such as C++, Java, Tcl, etc. can quickly start messing about and muddling along according to familiar paradigms. But the real power of Python only becomes apparent when one understands the advanced data types and language constructs that make Python a genuinely next generation language. The language style that arises from a full understanding of these features is called Pythonic, and to write as such, to write Pythonically. All this makes for compact and highly readable code, of which I thoroughly approve.
As the book progresses however the explanation of the core language becomes increasingly intermixed with aspects of the broader Python ecosystem which are necessarily brief in their treatment and often too brief for the text alone to stand on its own without getting ever more involved in the example code and following up on references to a large array of third party tools and their documentation. The authors seem keen to use the opportunity to cover a career's worth of general observations and best practice heuristics on the whole field of programming more generally. All good stuff, especially for beginners, but off the point for someone wanting to master the language and get on with their own projects. I would estimate that it could take a good few months for the diligent reader to really work through the material not just of the text, but the accompanying sample programs and the documentary references as well.
There's no doubt that a beginner or a computer science student would find this a really solid underpinning to a career both in writing Python and programming more generally. If, like me, you're in a bit of a hurry to get on and apply Python to your own purposes then much of the latter half of the book could feel like a distraction. Perhaps further down the line the areas covered there will tun out to be of relevant interest. How good a reference the book will then make is hard to say. As observed, on many topics the text alone is just too brief to give a confident grounding in the material covered."
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Danilo M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Like this book as begginer,Reviewed in Germany on 5 January 2022,"Learn Python programming, for begginers and advanced users."
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.
Fairly satisfied with this book and happy with/grateful for the foundation that’s it’s helped me lay so far!"

Upgraded to 3 star for now. Will revisit once book finished.
I'm currently working through this book and have completed chapter 1. I'm seriously doubting continuing with further chapters due to fundamental issues with some of the material.
1. Page 37 the material uses a work alongside example to use a Measure called Quantity. The measure called Quantity does not exist.
2. Page 9, it advises to navigate to the Nested Sorting tab. Unfortunately this tab doesnt exist.
To find two huge glaring errors in the first ten or so worked examples in what is a recap chapter of basic Tableau concepts is disconcerting on a THIRD edition of a book, and makes me doubt whether it is worth continuing with the rest of the book.
I may continue and if I get to the end and not find any further issues I may revisit this review."

X does this, Y does that, but not which to use and when.
It also bounces around with Chapter 1 referencing Chapter 2, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. This makes it even harder to understand.
Terms are constantly introduced with no explanation, to be frank its more lite a novel than an educational or instructive book."
Mastering Microsoft Power Bi: Expert techniques for effective data analytics and business intelligence,Gerry,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2019,This book might have some good content but I think its terrible because you cannot follow the examples given. This is because the actual database used to create all the examples shown is a modified version of the Adventure Works DW. I see no reason why this not provided in the code files. Its fine if you just want to read it as a novel but i prefer to get my hands dirty.

Apache Spark Quick Start Guide: Quickly learn the art of writing efficient big data applications with Apache Spark,Ulysses,3.0 out of 5 stars,"some useful material, but sloppy writing and editing",Reviewed in the United States on 2 May 2019,"I basically got what I wanted, which was a quick overview, with an intro to key concepts. Also some of the details addressed questions I had. I scouted a bunch of other books first, and it was the table-of-contents that sold me on this one.
The problem is that this feels like a first draft that nobody bothered to read through. I doubt that it's an exaggeration to say that the average page has a dozen glaring syntax problems that could easily have been fixed. The figures are often poorly labelled, or even poorly conceived. There are extra or missing words. It might be that I actually learned a little more than I would have otherwise, because at a few places I had to decipher some garbled text to work out what the authors must have meant, whereas cleaned-up text might've gone in one ear and out the other.
The concepts are accessible. The scope seems thorough, for a quick introduction. It's not so bad that you can't breeze your way through it, but it feels like a hasty job slapped into print without any supervision."

"Software Architecture with Python: Design and architect highly scalable, robust, clean, and high performance applications in Python",kracekumar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Intersection of Python and Software Engineering loaded with content,Reviewed in India on 9 May 2017,"The book Software Architecture with Python explains various aspects of software architecture like testability, performance, scaling, concurrency and design patterns.
The book has ten chapters. The first chapter speaks about different architect roles like solution architect, enterprise architect, technical architect what is the role of an architect and difference between design and architecture. This chapter is theory but worth to know the differences as a software developer.
The book covers two lesser spoken topics debugging and code security which I liked. There is very few literature available on debugging. The author has provided real use cases of different debugging tips and tools for Python without picking sides. The book has some good examples on overflow errors in Python.
My favorite chapter in the book is 'Writing Applications that scale'. The author explains all the available concurrency primitives like threading, multiprocess, eventlet, twisted, gevent, asyncio, queues, semaphore, locking etc . The author doesn't stop by explaining how to use them but paves the path to figuring out how to profile the code, find out where the bottleneck lies and when to use which concurrency primitives. This chapter is the longest in the book and deluged with examples and insights. The author's approach of using `time` command to measure the performance rather than sticking with wall-clock time gives the developer understanding of where programming is spending most of the time.
The book covers vital details on implementing Python Design Patterns and how Python's dynamic nature brings joy while creating the creational, structural and design pattern. The showcased examples teach how Python metaclass works and it's simplicity.
The book is indeed a long read and solid one in size and content. Having said that book is pretty hands on and loaded with trivial and non-trivial examples. I won't be surprised if half the book covers the code snippets. The author hasn't shied away from skipping code snippets while explaining any concept. The book introduces a plethora of tools for developing software, and at the same time references required literature and resources."
"Software Architecture with Python: Design and architect highly scalable, robust, clean, and high performance applications in Python",sh,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to read, too many typos",Reviewed in the United States on 4 April 2018,"This book is easy to read and understand, as long as you have an understanding of Python. The example code illustrates the point the author is trying to convey. The main problem, and the reason I deducted 2 stars, is there are a lot of typos. Every 2 or 3 pages, has some sort of typo. There are also some bugs in the code examples (i.e. setting a variable with a value, and then referencing the value instead of the variable name). There is even at least one code example where all of the code is left-justified, so it makes the code technically incorrect without any indentation."

It feels like the book started off as ""Software Architecture"" and then the author plugged in Python at the end.
If you're used to well-produced books, this one might set your teeth on edge. The book could use a much better copyedit than what it got, the artwork is amateurish, and the page layout looks like it was chosen to make the book longer."

Learn SQL Database Programming: Query and manipulate databases from popular relational database servers using SQL,Just Some Guy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Should be called ""Intro to Using MySQL Workbench""",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2022,"This isn't a bad book - it's actually pretty good. It's just not what the title claims. This book is good a good buy for 1 of these 2 use cases:
1) You're brand new to using a real database (Excel and Access don't count), and you want a high-level introduction to using MySQL and writing SQL queries, etc.
2) You're quite good with SQL and databases already, and you just want a reference on your desk you can flip open to check the syntax on part of your query, or similar reference-type needs.
Besides that, I think this book is a miss. It's covers a lot of ground, but it moves really fast, and barely anything goes into much depth. As a result, if you're new to SQL then you won't actually *learn* much here (there are too few examples, and they never go into much depth) – but if you're a pro this is all pretty obvious, so you won't learn anything new.
My main other complaint about this book is that for a book with ""Programming"" in the title, it barely meets that standard at all. Besides a quick pass on functions and stored procedures (which do involve programming via SQL), almost everything this book does is via the MySQL Workbench tool. Now, that's great if learning Workbench is your goal - but if you want to manage your database via APIs, or do anything programmatic whatsoever (via a language like Python, Java, etc.), this book has ZERO on ANY of that. The work ""Programming"" has no place in the title of this book.
Two other minor complaints:
1) There are some sloppy typos and technical errors that should have been caught by the editors - and that happened a couple times too many for me to ignore.
2) The book really feels like the author was trying to pad the page count. There are a TON of screenshots (again, mostly of MySQL Workbench). While I usually like those, for reference, they were larger and more frequent than necessary. There are also pages of content that get very repetitive - like, the author would often repeat the same exact paragraph multiple times when explaining a list of things that were mostly the same, but had only slight differences. (for example, a full paragraph explaining an example with a logical TRUE/IN/= use case, and then the exact same paragraph repeated again but with just a couple words changed to explain the respective FALSE/NOT IN/!= use case). Pages of text could have been saved by using a more compact writing approach.
All that said, this is a pretty good book for the 2 needs I mentioned at the top of this review. If that's you, buy it and make the most of it. But anyone wanting to really learn how to ""program SQL"" will need to read a few other books, too. Now you know."
Learn SQL Database Programming: Query and manipulate databases from popular relational database servers using SQL,Pseudonym,2.0 out of 5 stars,Gibt vermutlich bessere Bücher zu dem Thema,Reviewed in Germany on 25 July 2021,"Nachdem ich von einem anderen Buch des Packt-Verlag (C#9 and .net5 modern cross-platform development) echt angetan war, habe ich mir dieses Buch gekauft. Leider muss ich sagen, dass dieses Buch ein Ärgernis ist.
Ich bin gerade mal auf S.115 und schon über so viele Fehler gestolpert, dass es mir echt vorm Rest des Buches graust.
Ein paar Beispiele: S.18 ""the primary keys ensures that all values in a column are not null and UNIQUE..."" Auf S.29 wird dann anhand einer Tabelle behauptet, dass die Kombination aus playerID and teamID einen Primary key ergeben. In Zeile 2 dieser Tabelle steht: abreubo01 (als playerID) und PHI (als teamID), in Zeile 3 steht das selbe. Man müsste die yearID noch mit dazu nehmen, um einen primary key zu erhalten, was auf S.17 auch schon mal festgestellt wurde.
Auf S.114 im Abschnitt many-to-many table relationships wird im Text dann fälschlicherweise von einer one-to-many geschrieben.
Dazu kommt noch, dass die Seiten teilweise wirklich mit belanglosen Informationen zugemüllt wurden. Die Autorin hat sich entschieden MySQL zu benutzen, dann möchte ich nicht auf jeder Seite zu Datentypen lesen, wie sich das von anderen Datenbanksystemen unterscheidet, dass kann man einmal als Info erwähnen und in einem Anhang kompakt auflisten. Dann ist das Kapital halt nur 10 statt 20 Seiten lang.
Hingegen wird man im Kapitel 2 aufgefordert eine Datenbank von GitHub runterzuladen, wo man eventuell anhand eines Screenshots oder erläuterten Text erklären könnte, wie das funktioniert (Google hilft weiter).
Das alles ist kein Beinbruch und man kann sich sicherlich auch anhand dieses Buches einen Zugang zu SQL erarbeiten, aber es gibt keinen Grund dieses Buch zu nutzen, da es ziemlich sicher bessere gibt."

However, halfway through the book (starting with the Sockets,Files, and Streams chapter) the authors start cutting corners (likely because book got too bulky). They now no longer showcase complete or relevant code and instead one has to constantly jump to one’s laptop to look through the code, which is inconvenient and inefficient.

"C++ High Performance: Master the art of optimizing the functioning of your C++ code, 2nd Edition",Biscuit brain,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good book, poor format",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2022,"This is a good book for new Cpp developers.

"C++ High Performance: Master the art of optimizing the functioning of your C++ code, 2nd Edition",Pedro,4.0 out of 5 stars,A book on modern C++ that covers many performance-related topics,Reviewed in Italy on 7 May 2022,"The book is well written, easy to read, and full of code snippets that help understand its content. It covers many topics: the first half is about essential modern C++ techniques, algorithms, and data structures, while the second half covers memory management, compile-time programming, multithreading, and coroutines.
Covering so many topics in a 500 pages book has the advantage of giving a good general idea of what optimizing code means, how to do so in C++20, and what to be aware of. The downside is that the surface is barely scratched: there are books on algorithms or concurrent programming alone that are longer than this entire book.
I was mostly interested in the second half of the book, which has a chapter on memory management that I really wanted to read. I can't say that thanks to this book I now have an in-depth knowledge of how the OS manages memory, but I still learned a lot and I am glad I bought it. A special mention goes to the compile-time programming and multithreading chapters, they are very well done.
Finally, a small negative note: the coroutines' chapters, especially the one on asynchronous programming, are quite cryptic compared to the rest of the book. Coroutines are not fully supported in the standard library yet, so even their basic usage is very complex, and at the end of the aforementioned chapters, I felt like I didn't learn that much. I would have preferred a greater focus on other topics, leaving coroutines for a future edition, when they'll be properly supported."

You'll need prior C++ experience as the authors dive right in - this is terrific for experienced coders as there is little or no wasted space on trivia.
It's a bit hard to try out all the features as many compilers haven't caught up yet (June 2021) but the explanations are very clear.
In addition, I find that the teaching style is very good. I've read several C++ books where it is difficult to read, say, chapter 10 because the examples all expect you know what's in the examples in chapters 7, 8 and 9 (ie they just expand on examples form earlier chapters). In this book I find the examples nicely self-contained."
"Modern C++ Programming Cookbook: Master C++ core language and standard library features, with over 100 recipes, updated to C++20, 2nd Edition",User0910,4.0 out of 5 stars,Un introduction réjouissante aux principales évolutions du langage depuis C++11,Reviewed in France on 8 May 2021,"Le livre s'adresse à un public un peu particulier, ayant connaissance du C++11 (certains de ses concepts de base comme la move sementic n'y sont tout simplement pas expliqués), mais ayant une connaissance beaucoup plus vague des consolidations et des apports successifs des standards ultérieurs (C++14/17/20), et en quête de bonnes pratiques.
Lorsque l'on tombe dans cette catégorie, le livre est vraiment très agréable à parcourir. Chacune des recettes met concrètement et simplement en lumière un apport récent du langage et explique comment l'utiliser au mieux. C'est vraiment très simple, et en même temps jouissif, les apports récents fait au langage étant vraiment fondamentaux et puissant (il suffit de voir comment un simple ""constexpr if"" anéanti instantanément des années de template metaprogramming absolument néfaste).
Ensuite, on ne va pas se mentir, ce livre ne gagnera jamais de prix pour son style ni même pour sa pédagogie -- l'auteur est parfois un peu court d'explication, notamment au chapitre sur les threads je trouve. L'auteur se contente de rendre fidèlement les évolutions du langages et les bonnes pratiques en vigueur. L'intérêt du livre est au fond intimement lié à celui du langage, et c'est déjà bien."

I found that ""Professional C++"" by Marc Gregoire, was exactly what I was looking for.
I now recognize that with ""Cookbook"" in its title, that my expecting it to also cover everything in C++ was expecting too much. I was also put off by the ""feel"" of this $50 book- the paper is thick and rough and fluffs this ~800 page book out so that it's thicker than Pro C++'s ~1,300 pages! And the content on each page uses large fonts and line spacing so that Pro C++ probably gets 50% more info on each page. I really don't like seeing this kind of thing being done to try to convince me that this is a really worth $50. It makes me also wonder about the content, but it sounds from other reviews that it is actually a good ""cookbook"".

As argued by several other reviews, you can find all the content online and even in more depth but that is true for literally anything now a day. It gives a thorough introduction in itself, and the language used is quite easy.
About the test written too small, that is indeed true but should be a problem. I used quite a small font on my computer, so I don't even notice the difference. People who do not use computers as much may feel it is too small.
There are indeed quite an amount of error and typing mistakes in the book but I have never felt too hindered by that since it takes about 2 minutes to confirm something online and it usually be clear that something must be an error.
I've given it a 4 star rating just because of the typing errors but a good book overall."

Data Structures And Algorithms Made Easy: Data Structures And Algorithmic Puzzles,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Incredibly erroneous,Reviewed in India on 11 June 2019,"For a best selling book, one that seems to have accumulated a whole bunch of good reviews, the amount of mistakes and errors in this book is mind boggling. I will not even get started on the sheer volume of spelling/grammar/language mistakes throughout the book - what is beyond belief is the extent of programming mistakes in just about every alternate page. Many of the code will not even compile due to syntax errors of all kinds. There are logical errors in a good percentage of the code samples given for various algorithms. I find it hard to believe that someone can read this book thoroughly and yet be in a frame of mind to award a positive review. This review might sound harsh at first blush; if in doubt, just look at the back cover and read the book description where you can spot errors (eg: taiwan and korea are not languages; taiwanese and korean are). If the back cover is not spared, what can you expect from the content inside? This need not necessarily be a reflection on the author's skill or competency as far as computer science is concerned, but it most assuredly is a firm pointer that nobody associated with the author, or the author himself, has put in even a second of effort to proof-read the book. Highly unprofessional, to say the least."

Data Structures And Algorithms Made Easy: Data Structures And Algorithmic Puzzles,Z,4.0 out of 5 stars,A broad but shallow survey of algorithms,Reviewed in the United States on 21 March 2018,"If you're a computer science student at the undergrad or graduate level, or you work with computer algorithms in work (or *want* to do such work), this book might be useful to have on your shelf. I would not use this book to learn the basics of algorithms in the first place, but more as a companion book to a more traditional textbook, to get a summary of facts and a good overview of a wide range of algorithms. Comparing it to other algorithm and data structure textbooks, the material in this book is wide but shallow. There are many different algorithms and data structures examined--easily more than any other algorithm book I've come across--but you get almost a ""Cliff's Notes"" summary of the algorithm a lot of times. For example, in O'Reilly's ""Algorithms in a Nutshell"" and Sedgewick's ""Algorithms"", merge sort gets a deep treatment with several implementations shown in each book and a lot of words of analysis. However, in Mr. Karumanchi's book, it gets a single page with one implementation, a handful of bullet points, and a few sentences of analysis. Don't expect much in the way of mathematical proofs or theory here, but rather a straight to the point mindset. Which, if you've already studied merge sort before, and just want some basic questions answered (What is the recurrence relation? What is the space/time complexity? Why would I use this over another sorting algorithm?) could well be exactly what you need."

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,GOLAK M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome,Reviewed in India on 29 January 2022,Well written book to work with robotics as the authors provided various practical examples starting from scratch
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.
I recommend this book to anyone who has attempted, and even partially succeeded at, learning ROS from Google and the wiki but a thorough understanding of the system is still not quite achieved."

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,安相訓,1.0 out of 5 stars,Miserable book,Reviewed in Japan on 24 April 2022,"Fundamentals described poorly and and explanations on sample code are not enough and requests copy codes from github repo.
Unfornately, codes on github aren't executed clearly but make error and warning messages.
So, if you try to learn ROS with this material, you may waste much time to debug it with external references such as ROS wiki or youtube."
