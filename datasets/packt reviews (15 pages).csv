Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Mohd Azam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 25 May 2022,This is best book for advance NLP tasks. BERT is not more complex … recommended for NLP developers
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,MRS IYENGAR,5.0 out of 5 stars,A pitch-perfect book in regards to getting started with BERT in NLP.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 7 March 2021,"The amount of in-depth information compiled about BERT and its varients in this book is quite astonishing. The content is top-notch with great visual explanations. Encoders and decoders are very hard to explain. In this book encoder and decoder chapters are peaches, they are explained with absolute perfection. The range of BERT variants in this book is mind-blowing, the book contains BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, TInyBERT, BERTSUM, etc. My favorite BERT models are XLM-R, Sentence BERT, and VideoBERT. The author explains each and every concept with ease. I personally felt very happy to have purchased and read the book. I thank the author for writing such a gem of a book. If you looking for a book to strengthen your knowledge of NLP, Deep Learning, BERT this is the go-to book. Hope my suggestion helps."

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,ani,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome book for learning BERT,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 5 February 2021,"The book explains transformers and BERT in very detail. I’m awestruck with the way the author have explained the concepts in a seamlessly simple way possible. I really loved the narrative style of the book.
I can’t believe someone explained BERT with so much of in-depth detail. The book covers lot of things which I was never aware of and many different types of BERT like tinyBERT, ELECTRA, Multilingual BERT, XLM-R, and many others. If you are not getting this then definitely you are missing out a greatest content on BERT ever."

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very very bad quality printing,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 6 July 2021,Very bad quality printing! At such a high price printing quality was supposed to be excellent but it is worse than even news paper printing. So much so that sometimes it is causing readability issues.

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Jose,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not clear.,Reviewed in Germany 🇩🇪 on 16 August 2021,"It is the first time ever I write a review in amazon, but I could not satand this. The pic shows very UNCLEAR explanation of mathematical operations. What kind of operation is shown in fig. 1.18? There are other examples like this one. I understand that pack books are not reviewed at all but this is basic presentation stuff. I expect from a book to save me time for learning. If I habe to figure out myself half of the math then I might be as better off reading some blogs online. Besides the maths there is not enough logical explanation order. It really seems that someone who really knows a lot drops some basic points but totally forgetting that he is talking (writing) to someone who knows zero about transformers."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,駒井 雄一郎,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's like a student's report. It's no longer a primer but a catalogue of shallow knowledge.,Reviewed in Japan 🇯🇵 on 2 June 2022,"I was disappointed by the content. Huge number of typo, poor printing quality and above all, silly and floppy explanation. I couldn't understand what the author try to deliver to the readers.
I hope this crap will be sunk in the bottom of the search result."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,ML engineer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too superficial explanations,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 4 October 2021,"Pro: The book does add a little bit of details and explanations beyond what is written in the research papers (e.g. 'Attention is all you need', 'BERT -...'). In that regard, it is not completely worthless.
Contra: However, it stays too much on the surface. It repeats itself very often (i.e. the same sentence is repeated maybe 5-10 times inside one chapter, perhaps with a non-essential reordering of the sub-sentences). There would have been many opportunities to dig deeper or provide more understanding, besides what is already written in the research papers. But the book does not do this, by and large.
So, I am back to trying to study BERT deeper using tutorials and blog posts on the internet, which are typically not satisfactory, but provide a little bit more understanding and context into understanding BERT."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Dwayne Phillips,2.0 out of 5 stars,They tried....but failed,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 26 February 2022,"I gave two stars instead of one star for effort.
(1) I bought a copy in the fall of 2021. There were printing problems with subscripts and superscripts that made the text unreadable. In addition, some of the text in the figures was tiny. I wrote the publisher and they worked with me and eventually sent me a copy of the book with the printing improved.
(2) I tried and tried and tried to get through the first 20 pages of the book. It needs to be edited and rewritten. There are basic grammar and English mistakes in every paragraph. Perhaps the writing team does not write in English as a native language. Well, that is why publishers have editors. Well, they didn't edit this book.
(3) Good effort, they tried, but they failed."

"Mastering Machine Learning with R -: Advanced prediction, algorithms, and learning methods with R 3.x",Jose Luis,1.0 out of 5 stars,Achtung! Book is full of erratas,Reviewed in Germany 🇩🇪 on 5 October 2017,"Sometimes, the code in the book doesn't work (R shows error messages and stop running the code) because the data doesn't meet the function requirements.
Charts are duplicated / missed what makes not possible to follow the examples properly.
This book can be used to get notions about the process but not not master ML with R unless you have R and stats knowledge that enables you to rewrite some code.

OpenStack Essentials -,Amazon Kunde,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Leider sehr oberflächlich, selbst für Grundlagen",Reviewed in Germany 🇩🇪 on 20 December 2016,"Wer sich wirklich mit OpenStack beschäftigen will, ist gut beraten sich die offizielle Dokumentation durchzulesen.

OpenStack Essentials -,Bill Stone,1.0 out of 5 stars,low effort publishing,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 27 January 2017,Poorly written. Clearly rushed into print with no editorial review.

SQL for Data Analytics - Third Edition: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data,KenO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic introduction to sql & data analytics,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 15 September 2022,"This book does a great job of introducing SQL topics in a way that is intuitive and easily understood while not being frustrating in its simplicity.
I'm very new to using SQL and was stumbling through learning joins & aggregate functions when I was given the opportunity to review a pre-release copy of this book & I've gotta say that I'm unbelievably grateful for that.
Instead of struggling to make it through questionably worded online references, I have been guided through well written & intelligently motivated instruction & examples. I've learned a great deal from this book so far & I'm only about 6 chapters in.
If you're just getting started in the world of SQL, ""SQL for Data Analytics"" is an excellent guide.
Working my way through the book has given me a solid understanding of the content & has enabled me to expand beyond the examples provided & build useful queries that are already proving their worth to my team.
Highly recommended."
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 October 2017,Useless
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,alex3410,2.0 out of 5 stars,Info looks good but layout is poor,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 12 January 2018,"First impressions are the information is good but the formatting is really really poor - code sections have not been formatted for print so lines run on to multiple lines making it hard to read
No spacing between sections of code also make it hard to read with it all forming huge blocks of text
Finally you are presented with complete code samples explained with comments within the code rather then separate sections - these comments are not immediately obvious & again run over causing confusion as to if the text is part of the comment or code
It’s annoying because the topics complex enough as it is without struggling with poor layout
Update : finished the book, poor formatting continues throughout & makes it harder to understand the examples, writing in places is poor which again makes it harder to understand.
That being said it’s got useful information in there & worth reading if only because the number of books on CI development are slim"
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Dean Barker,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't bother on Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 3 March 2014,The php code is not formatted correctly and is very difficult to follow. New lines are not new lines and the comments merge with the actual code in one big messy block. Never buying another tech book from Kindle again. Would get a refund if its possible but its been too ling since I bought.
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Ola Klingberg,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite ready for printing yet.,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 12 September 2014,"This book might become worthy of three or ever four stars, once it’s finished, but this sloppily proof-read draft should not have been published. I’m at page 45, and I’m giving up now.
Both the general text and the code examples are so littered with typos and misused words that they are often difficult to make sense of.
The text reads “a single comma” when they mean “single quotes.” It says “The Boolean and contacts” when they mean “Booleans and constants.” The introduction to an example says that it “... creates a form for adding and editing a product” when in fact the example that follows is for a contact form that has nothing to do with any products.
And the code often looks like this:
function index () {
// executed when referring to My_handlercontroller via
URLecho “Hello World”; }
You have to look at that for a minute to figure out what is code and what is comment, since the lines have been muddled together.
I’m thinking about requesting a refund, even though I’ve made some highlighting. This book was simply not ready to be sent to the printer."
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Eric D. Brown,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not much ""new"" here",Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 4 March 2014,I took a chance on this book and I'm not that happy that I did. This book provides very little in the way of 'new' examples and definitely stays away from any in-depth discussions of CodeIgniter. There's nothing in this book that you can't find on the CI website.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",John Ferngrove,4.0 out of 5 stars,How much time do you have?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 11 June 2022,"I've docked a star from this rating because this book is not ideal for busy people who want to quickly learn the language so they can get on with their own projects. To get the best out of this book one would have to download the chapter examples, work through their code, which is much more than is presented in the text, and follow up all the links and references to documentation and dependencies which cover the entirety of the immense Python ecosystem. If I did have the time to follow up on every reference I would probably give the book five stars.
The earlier part of the book deals very well with the core language. People like myself coming to Python from earlier generation languages such as C++, Java, Tcl, etc. can quickly start messing about and muddling along according to familiar paradigms. But the real power of Python only becomes apparent when one understands the advanced data types and language constructs that make Python a genuinely next generation language. The language style that arises from a full understanding of these features is called Pythonic, and to write as such, to write Pythonically. All this makes for compact and highly readable code, of which I thoroughly approve.
As the book progresses however the explanation of the core language becomes increasingly intermixed with aspects of the broader Python ecosystem which are necessarily brief in their treatment and often too brief for the text alone to stand on its own without getting ever more involved in the example code and following up on references to a large array of third party tools and their documentation. The authors seem keen to use the opportunity to cover a career's worth of general observations and best practice heuristics on the whole field of programming more generally. All good stuff, especially for beginners, but off the point for someone wanting to master the language and get on with their own projects. I would estimate that it could take a good few months for the diligent reader to really work through the material not just of the text, but the accompanying sample programs and the documentary references as well.
There's no doubt that a beginner or a computer science student would find this a really solid underpinning to a career both in writing Python and programming more generally. If, like me, you're in a bit of a hurry to get on and apply Python to your own purposes then much of the latter half of the book could feel like a distraction. Perhaps further down the line the areas covered there will tun out to be of relevant interest. How good a reference the book will then make is hard to say. As observed, on many topics the text alone is just too brief to give a confident grounding in the material covered."
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Danilo M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Like this book as begginer,Reviewed in Germany 🇩🇪 on 5 January 2022,"Learn Python programming, for begginers and advanced users."
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.
Fairly satisfied with this book and happy with/grateful for the foundation that’s it’s helped me lay so far!"
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Areohbe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great if you have some prior computer science knowledge and math skills,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 18 April 2022,"This book is great! Not the most thorough but covers all the bases none the less. As the description states it is preferable to have some experience with computer science. I think anyone could pick up think book and learn SOME python. However, there are some parts that someone with no knowledge will likely struggle and will need outside support."

However, I decided to give this book a try as I was looking for a book on Tableau 2022 and this was the most recent book on Tableau released so far. Just finished the first chapter, this book is very helpful and well written so far. I might add more to his review later once I am done with the whole book."

Other books focus on programming the concepts but don't go in depth on the math behind it. From start to finish this book gives you both worlds. No longer do i have this black mystery box mentality of implementing an algorithm(using a library) knowing how to use it but have no idea how it works behind the scenes. This book combines a mathematician, developer, and has Business logic. I Would highly recommend this book."

"Mastering Tableau 2021: Implement advanced business intelligence techniques and analytics with Tableau, 3rd Edition",Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Riddled with errors...so far.. but fixed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 26 October 2021,"Update: Excellent support from Publisher who has fixed the online Tableau and will update text for next edition. Upgraded to 3 star for now. Will revisit once book finished.
I'm currently working through this book and have completed chapter 1. I'm seriously doubting continuing with further chapters due to fundamental issues with some of the material.
1. Page 37 the material uses a work alongside example to use a Measure called Quantity. The measure called Quantity does not exist.
2. Page 9, it advises to navigate to the Nested Sorting tab. Unfortunately this tab doesnt exist.
To find two huge glaring errors in the first ten or so worked examples in what is a recap chapter of basic Tableau concepts is disconcerting on a THIRD edition of a book, and makes me doubt whether it is worth continuing with the rest of the book.
I may continue and if I get to the end and not find any further issues I may revisit this review."

All they had to do was number the chapters visibly on the navigation. Readers are not necessarily always trying to read the entire book in sequence, publisher should make navigation efficient.

Mastering Microsoft Power Bi: Expert techniques for effective data analytics and business intelligence,A G.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very poorly written and difficult to follow,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 3 June 2019,"Looking at the Table of Contents this appears to be a comprehensive book to help with the setting up and administering of Microsoft PowerBI. However, The content itself is very difficult to follow and key explanations of 'why' are missing. It fails to explain why one technique would be better used than another. X does this, Y does that, but not which to use and when.
It also bounces around with Chapter 1 referencing Chapter 2, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. This makes it even harder to understand.
Terms are constantly introduced with no explanation, to be frank its more lite a novel than an educational or instructive book."

The book teaches you Django by building 4 complete projects that include integration with other technologies like Redis, Celery, Memcached and multiple Python libraries and third-party Django applications.
This book does the best job covering the basics of Django and much more than that. The book is easy to follow but assumes you some basic Python and web development knowledge (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I love the examples to create a recommendation engine, a Facebook-like user activity feed and real-time async chat application using channels."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Esteban,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buen libro sobre CMake,Reviewed in Spain 🇪🇸 on 16 May 2022,"Llevo varios años usando CMake y quería darle un repaso al 'CMake moderno' para limpiar partes obsoletas de mis proyectos así que me decidí por este libro.
Es un buen libro tanto para iniciarse (3 primeros capítulos) como para profundizar en temas más avanzados de CMake. Los tres primeros capítulos abarca lo más básico para comenzar con CMake. Se ve como crear un ejecutable, una librería estática o dinámica, estructuras condicionales, presentación de opciones al usuario, trabajo con librerías de terceros, ...
El 4° capítulo va sobre como trabajar con pruebas unitarias. Me parece muy acertado que hayan incluido ejemplos para google test y boost test. También tiene otro ejemplo con Valgrind para detectar problemas de memoría. Aquí hecho de menos que no se haya incluido también Visual Leak Detector.
Lo que no me convence es que hayan dejado para el capítulo 7 la estructuración de un proyecto CMake. Personalmente creo que es de las primeras cosas que se debería explicar.
Incluye también la instalación, el empaquetado con CPack, documentación con Doxigen y Sphin, CDash.
Otro acierto del libro es utilizar en los ejemplos librerías como OpenMP, Eigen, Blas, Lapack o Boost.
Todos los ejemplos están en GitHub lo cual es de agradecer."
"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante."

Celui-là n'a pas de grandes qualités pédagogiques et manque pas mal de recul: études de cas concrets, mais pas forcément facile de trouver des infos précises sans tout dépiauter.
Mais au moins il amène de l'info sur l'usage moderne de CMake, et reste abordable et bien écrit."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",David C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jam packed with useful information about CMake,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 7 September 2020,"The author is modest in calling this book a Cookbook. It is really so much more than that. It is a well-structured tutorial and how-to as well. The recipes build on prior recipes. Everything is explained in detail, including concepts and background about CMake. The author provides a ready-made Docker image with all the needed tools pre-installed, and a Git repository with all the book's example code. You can actually edit, build, and run the examples in the Docker image as you are reading the book. This is very helpful. I was up and running the recipes in about 10 minutes (only because I needed to install Docker on my system - otherwise it would have been 2 minutes!).
I am a professional embedded C++ developer who inherited a complex CMake build environment at work, which I need to enhance and modify. I had never been exposed to CMake before. This book is proving to be an extremely valuable resource for me, helping me to understand what I am dealing with and how to modify it."

The book itself is good and complete, however the Kindle version is not only missing large sections which are in the book, but there are also pages and sections completely mixed up and out of order.

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,GOLAK M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 January 2022,Well written book to work with robotics as the authors provided various practical examples starting from scratch
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia 🇦🇺 on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.
I recommend this book to anyone who has attempted, and even partially succeeded at, learning ROS from Google and the wiki but a thorough understanding of the system is still not quite achieved."

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Antony Vilson,2.0 out of 5 stars,This book is highly overpriced for its contents.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 13 June 2022,"It covers many things but none in detail except a few. Page quality is good, write style is great.
But highly overpriced and disappointed."
Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Anand pL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Books for Learning Python Beginner to Advanced level,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 December 2021,"This book is an industry-level book that will help you to develop the coding skills in Python that can be used for tackling complex real-world problems that will help you to perform Automation in difficult use cases.
In this book, you’ll build on that foundational knowledge to learn how to leverage tools, libraries, and best practices to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code.
This book explains the tricks and traps that turn a few lines of Python code into much more than expected, which often leads to bugs and crashes if not written or understood correctly.
It also covers techniques for catching performance issues before they occur and debugging code efficiently when problems arise.
The content of this book is culled from code examples provided by experienced Python programmers who have encountered the same problems that you will encounter and deal with them effectively."
Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers. Suggested further reading tips are very useful and can be found at the end of each chapter. What is missing is a few questions related to developing a solution based on what is learnt in the chapter.
A very good book to read and expand your knowledge. Kudos to the author for the effort that has gone into writing the book."

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Fluff,3.0 out of 5 stars,Content is briliant. Poor index & contents listings make it very hard to use as a reference. Physical quality of book is dismal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 December 2015,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.
Note: My comments refer to Pearson New International Edition - 3rd edition ISBN-10: 1292024208, ISBN-13: 978-1292024202."
Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Ben Tristem,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Edition 3 is broken,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 11 April 2018,"Kindle Edition has serious issues where it renders mathematical symbols such as x and y as a tiny dot.

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,KENNETH MORE,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. ...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 September 2017,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. Also it refers to pages that do not contain information it claims to have. For example on page 245 it refers me to page 1066 for BNF. However if you go to page 1066 you find Bibliography. So I believe the book is incomplete as Appendixes are not included.
Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Rebecca J.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 24 January 2019,The book itself is meant to be well worth reading - this review is about the packaging and quality of the item received.

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,MRS IYENGAR,5.0 out of 5 stars,A pitch-perfect book in regards to getting started with BERT in NLP.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 7 March 2021,"The amount of in-depth information compiled about BERT and its varients in this book is quite astonishing. The content is top-notch with great visual explanations. Encoders and decoders are very hard to explain. In this book encoder and decoder chapters are peaches, they are explained with absolute perfection. The range of BERT variants in this book is mind-blowing, the book contains BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, TInyBERT, BERTSUM, etc. My favorite BERT models are XLM-R, Sentence BERT, and VideoBERT. The author explains each and every concept with ease. I personally felt very happy to have purchased and read the book. I thank the author for writing such a gem of a book. If you looking for a book to strengthen your knowledge of NLP, Deep Learning, BERT this is the go-to book. Hope my suggestion helps."

I’m awestruck with the way the author have explained the concepts in a seamlessly simple way possible. I really loved the narrative style of the book.
I can’t believe someone explained BERT with so much of in-depth detail. The book covers lot of things which I was never aware of and many different types of BERT like tinyBERT, ELECTRA, Multilingual BERT, XLM-R, and many others. If you are not getting this then definitely you are missing out a greatest content on BERT ever."

The pic shows very UNCLEAR explanation of mathematical operations. What kind of operation is shown in fig. 1.18? There are other examples like this one. I understand that pack books are not reviewed at all but this is basic presentation stuff. I expect from a book to save me time for learning. If I habe to figure out myself half of the math then I might be as better off reading some blogs online. Besides the maths there is not enough logical explanation order. It really seems that someone who really knows a lot drops some basic points but totally forgetting that he is talking (writing) to someone who knows zero about transformers."

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,ML engineer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too superficial explanations,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 4 October 2021,"Pro: The book does add a little bit of details and explanations beyond what is written in the research papers (e.g. 'Attention is all you need', 'BERT -...'). In that regard, it is not completely worthless.
Contra: However, it stays too much on the surface. It repeats itself very often (i.e. the same sentence is repeated maybe 5-10 times inside one chapter, perhaps with a non-essential reordering of the sub-sentences). There would have been many opportunities to dig deeper or provide more understanding, besides what is already written in the research papers. But the book does not do this, by and large.
So, I am back to trying to study BERT deeper using tutorials and blog posts on the internet, which are typically not satisfactory, but provide a little bit more understanding and context into understanding BERT."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Dwayne Phillips,2.0 out of 5 stars,They tried....but failed,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 26 February 2022,"I gave two stars instead of one star for effort.
(1) I bought a copy in the fall of 2021. There were printing problems with subscripts and superscripts that made the text unreadable. In addition, some of the text in the figures was tiny. I wrote the publisher and they worked with me and eventually sent me a copy of the book with the printing improved.
(2) I tried and tried and tried to get through the first 20 pages of the book. It needs to be edited and rewritten. There are basic grammar and English mistakes in every paragraph. Perhaps the writing team does not write in English as a native language. Well, that is why publishers have editors. Well, they didn't edit this book.
(3) Good effort, they tried, but they failed."

I'm very new to using SQL and was stumbling through learning joins & aggregate functions when I was given the opportunity to review a pre-release copy of this book & I've gotta say that I'm unbelievably grateful for that.
Instead of struggling to make it through questionably worded online references, I have been guided through well written & intelligently motivated instruction & examples. I've learned a great deal from this book so far & I'm only about 6 chapters in.
If you're just getting started in the world of SQL, ""SQL for Data Analytics"" is an excellent guide.
Working my way through the book has given me a solid understanding of the content & has enabled me to expand beyond the examples provided & build useful queries that are already proving their worth to my team.
Highly recommended."

"Artificial Intelligence By Example: Acquire advanced AI, machine learning, and deep learning design skills, 2nd Edition",michael mejia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps bridge many gaps other books fall short of doing,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 21 March 2020,"Too many books are only math oriented and miss the implementation of using such algorithms in programming languages. Other books focus on programming the concepts but don't go in depth on the math behind it. From start to finish this book gives you both worlds. No longer do i have this black mystery box mentality of implementing an algorithm(using a library) knowing how to use it but have no idea how it works behind the scenes. This book combines a mathematician, developer, and has Business logic. I Would highly recommend this book."

Django 4 By Example - Fourth Edition: Build powerful and reliable Python web applications from scratch,Mae,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended for Python programmers,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 21 September 2022,"This book is the most practical resource to learn Django. The book teaches you Django by building 4 complete projects that include integration with other technologies like Redis, Celery, Memcached and multiple Python libraries and third-party Django applications.
This book does the best job covering the basics of Django and much more than that. The book is easy to follow but assumes you some basic Python and web development knowledge (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I love the examples to create a recommendation engine, a Facebook-like user activity feed and real-time async chat application using channels."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Esteban,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buen libro sobre CMake,Reviewed in Spain 🇪🇸 on 16 May 2022,"Llevo varios años usando CMake y quería darle un repaso al 'CMake moderno' para limpiar partes obsoletas de mis proyectos así que me decidí por este libro.
Es un buen libro tanto para iniciarse (3 primeros capítulos) como para profundizar en temas más avanzados de CMake. Los tres primeros capítulos abarca lo más básico para comenzar con CMake. Se ve como crear un ejecutable, una librería estática o dinámica, estructuras condicionales, presentación de opciones al usuario, trabajo con librerías de terceros, ...
El 4° capítulo va sobre como trabajar con pruebas unitarias. Me parece muy acertado que hayan incluido ejemplos para google test y boost test. También tiene otro ejemplo con Valgrind para detectar problemas de memoría. Aquí hecho de menos que no se haya incluido también Visual Leak Detector.
Lo que no me convence es que hayan dejado para el capítulo 7 la estructuración de un proyecto CMake. Personalmente creo que es de las primeras cosas que se debería explicar.
Incluye también la instalación, el empaquetado con CPack, documentación con Doxigen y Sphin, CDash.
Otro acierto del libro es utilizar en los ejemplos librerías como OpenMP, Eigen, Blas, Lapack o Boost.
Todos los ejemplos están en GitHub lo cual es de agradecer."
"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante."
"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Thierry B.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Moui,Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 29 August 2019,"Il n'y a pas beaucoup d'ouvrages sur CMake, et la plupart se contentent d'imprimer le manuel.
Celui-là n'a pas de grandes qualités pédagogiques et manque pas mal de recul: études de cas concrets, mais pas forcément facile de trouver des infos précises sans tout dépiauter.
Mais au moins il amène de l'info sur l'usage moderne de CMake, et reste abordable et bien écrit."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",David C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jam packed with useful information about CMake,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 7 September 2020,"The author is modest in calling this book a Cookbook. It is really so much more than that. It is a well-structured tutorial and how-to as well. The recipes build on prior recipes. Everything is explained in detail, including concepts and background about CMake. The author provides a ready-made Docker image with all the needed tools pre-installed, and a Git repository with all the book's example code. You can actually edit, build, and run the examples in the Docker image as you are reading the book. This is very helpful. I was up and running the recipes in about 10 minutes (only because I needed to install Docker on my system - otherwise it would have been 2 minutes!).
I am a professional embedded C++ developer who inherited a complex CMake build environment at work, which I need to enhance and modify. I had never been exposed to CMake before. This book is proving to be an extremely valuable resource for me, helping me to understand what I am dealing with and how to modify it."
"Hands-On Application Penetration Testing with Burp Suite: Use Burp Suite and its features to inspect, detect, and exploit security vulnerabilities in your web applications",Kiwiness,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle version missing many sections!,Reviewed in Germany 🇩🇪 on 13 January 2021,"I bought both the paperback and Kindle version of this book. The book itself is good and complete, however the Kindle version is not only missing large sections which are in the book, but there are also pages and sections completely mixed up and out of order. The Kindle version should be pulled off the market and re-edited. Otherwise the book itself is full of up to date information on Burp Suite."
"Hands-On Application Penetration Testing with Burp Suite: Use Burp Suite and its features to inspect, detect, and exploit security vulnerabilities in your web applications",Noam,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken links to XVWA and OWASP make this book useless,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 7 June 2021,"This book would have been worth 5 stars had the links given to XVWA and OWASP worked.

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,GOLAK M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 January 2022,Well written book to work with robotics as the authors provided various practical examples starting from scratch
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia 🇦🇺 on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.
I recommend this book to anyone who has attempted, and even partially succeeded at, learning ROS from Google and the wiki but a thorough understanding of the system is still not quite achieved."

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Antony Vilson,2.0 out of 5 stars,This book is highly overpriced for its contents.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 13 June 2022,"It covers many things but none in detail except a few. Page quality is good, write style is great.
But highly overpriced and disappointed."
Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Anand pL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Books for Learning Python Beginner to Advanced level,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 December 2021,"This book is an industry-level book that will help you to develop the coding skills in Python that can be used for tackling complex real-world problems that will help you to perform Automation in difficult use cases.
In this book, you’ll build on that foundational knowledge to learn how to leverage tools, libraries, and best practices to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code.
This book explains the tricks and traps that turn a few lines of Python code into much more than expected, which often leads to bugs and crashes if not written or understood correctly.
It also covers techniques for catching performance issues before they occur and debugging code efficiently when problems arise.
The content of this book is culled from code examples provided by experienced Python programmers who have encountered the same problems that you will encounter and deal with them effectively."
Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers. Suggested further reading tips are very useful and can be found at the end of each chapter. What is missing is a few questions related to developing a solution based on what is learnt in the chapter.
A very good book to read and expand your knowledge. Kudos to the author for the effort that has gone into writing the book."

The concepts of this book are extremely simple.
It covers a wide range of topics in cryptography . But some parts can have more explanations . This is not the same as the original 900+ book by Stallings . Suggested for all those who are new to cryptographt . But if you look from programming poin tof view , this book may not be sufficient .

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Fluff,3.0 out of 5 stars,Content is briliant. Poor index & contents listings make it very hard to use as a reference. Physical quality of book is dismal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 December 2015,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.
Note: My comments refer to Pearson New International Edition - 3rd edition ISBN-10: 1292024208, ISBN-13: 978-1292024202."
Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Ben Tristem,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Edition 3 is broken,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 11 April 2018,"Kindle Edition has serious issues where it renders mathematical symbols such as x and y as a tiny dot.

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,KENNETH MORE,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. ...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 September 2017,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. Also it refers to pages that do not contain information it claims to have. For example on page 245 it refers me to page 1066 for BNF. However if you go to page 1066 you find Bibliography. So I believe the book is incomplete as Appendixes are not included.
Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Rebecca J.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 24 January 2019,The book itself is meant to be well worth reading - this review is about the packaging and quality of the item received.

Charts are duplicated / missed what makes not possible to follow the examples properly.

Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,alex3410,2.0 out of 5 stars,Info looks good but layout is poor,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 12 January 2018,"First impressions are the information is good but the formatting is really really poor - code sections have not been formatted for print so lines run on to multiple lines making it hard to read
No spacing between sections of code also make it hard to read with it all forming huge blocks of text
Finally you are presented with complete code samples explained with comments within the code rather then separate sections - these comments are not immediately obvious & again run over causing confusion as to if the text is part of the comment or code
It’s annoying because the topics complex enough as it is without struggling with poor layout
Update : finished the book, poor formatting continues throughout & makes it harder to understand the examples, writing in places is poor which again makes it harder to understand.
That being said it’s got useful information in there & worth reading if only because the number of books on CI development are slim"
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Dean Barker,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't bother on Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 3 March 2014,The php code is not formatted correctly and is very difficult to follow.

Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Ola Klingberg,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite ready for printing yet.,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 12 September 2014,"This book might become worthy of three or ever four stars, once it’s finished, but this sloppily proof-read draft should not have been published. I’m at page 45, and I’m giving up now.
Both the general text and the code examples are so littered with typos and misused words that they are often difficult to make sense of.
The text reads “a single comma” when they mean “single quotes.” It says “The Boolean and contacts” when they mean “Booleans and constants.” The introduction to an example says that it “... creates a form for adding and editing a product” when in fact the example that follows is for a contact form that has nothing to do with any products.
And the code often looks like this:
function index () {
// executed when referring to My_handlercontroller via
URLecho “Hello World”; }
You have to look at that for a minute to figure out what is code and what is comment, since the lines have been muddled together.
I’m thinking about requesting a refund, even though I’ve made some highlighting. This book was simply not ready to be sent to the printer."

Complementary methods will enable more transparent, interpretable, and explainable systems, making them easier to understand and trust. Most technical approaches to xAI were shown, starting with the data-centric approach and moving on to ways to get information out of a model, such as how important a feature is, how important it is compared to other features, or how to get rules out of a model. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about DS domains."

The figures are blurry and sometimes unreadable. They look like low-resolution screenshots copied and pasted onto the pages. I was hoping this book would at least give a helpful introduction to statistics and machine learning, but I was disappointed. Take, for example, the section on distributions and statistical tests. The descriptions were so terse and confusing that I wouldn't even have understood the relation between Bernoulli distributions and binomial distributions if I hadn't already known this. I was expecting much better for the price I paid.

Mastering Swift 4 - Fourth Edition: An in-depth and comprehensive guide to modern programming techniques with Swift,Bruce D Link,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, somewhat preachy, introduction to programming and designing Swift applications",Reviewed in Canada 🇨🇦 on 26 October 2018,"I came to this book to learn the swift language, with a strong background in Ada, C++, C#, Java (as far as OO languages go).
I find the book a good overview for people wanting to learn the language, rather then wanting to learn just enough to cobble together an iOS or MacOS graphical application.
My main anoyance is that the author confuses OO with single inheritance OO and implicitly assumes OOD is single inheritance OOD. Then Swift prototypes (which much of the rest of the world calls interfaces) become a new wonderful thing.
C++, Ada, C#, Java could do all of this at least 10 years before Apple proclamed Protocol oriented programming in, according to the author, 2016. In reality, protocols are just a way to remove the worst dangers of multiple inheritance while preserving most of the benifits.
If you ignore the tone of the writing on protocols and focus on the book's substance, you are left with a good introductoy to mid-level book.

I wish author spent more time covering more challenging topics like concurrency or memory management, instead there are pages of simple stuff with lots of unnecessary examples. Nevertheless, it is easy to read and not boring if you skip some stuff and I recommend this book beginners."
UiPath Administration and Support Guide: Learn industry-standard practices for UiPath program support and administration activities,Mathan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent guide for Robotice process automation Centre of excellence(CoE) team,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 25 September 2022,"The flow of content is exemplary in a simple, elegant way of expressing key points. The CoE team and specifically the production support resources will find this book very helpful in managing Bots with the least effort. Usually, support resources learn on the job by dirtying hands but this book helps to begin with a very structured way of managing Bots.
The service engineers will get the wisdom of awareness and anticipate any incident in the Bots, platform and fix it leading to stress-free productivity.
What is missing with the support team is the end-to-end mapping of the product which is very well explained in this book. Reading this book, resources will have the visibility of end-to-end awareness giving visibility and the capability to relate and connect the dots.
Structured managed services of Bots in production only can give sustainable resilient growth for Intelligent automation programs."

NumPy Essentials,A. Priest,2.0 out of 5 stars,needs a serious update and better editing,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 25 February 2018,"This book contains numerous typos, omissions, and some of the stuff in it either doesn't work outright or are obsolete. I read every chapter except the final one, and although I learned a lot from the stuff that do work, and learned a lot from trying to make the things that don't work, finally work, I can't honestly give this book more than 2 stars.
Here are some examples of typos:
Pg 121, PyMethodDefApi_methods is really PyMethodDef Api_methods. I thought the data type is missing, but couldn't figure out which part is the variable name and which part is the type. This is by no means the only mistake of its kind in this book. There are many, and you must figure out where to insert the spaces to make the codes work. If you're a newbie and want to type along and run the codes as you go, which is pretty much how everyone learns Python from the beginning, you'll spend a lot of time doing this.
The is a part of the book that refers to colored graphs, but this book is black and white. I don't remember which part, but I was disappointed the editor didn't correct that.
If you want to build a C API, Py_InitModule3( ) is no longer supported. (My C compiler flagged it as a warning and I looked it up.) Python 3+ uses PyModuleDef(). This book was published in 2016, but Python 3 came out in 2008.
You'd find many typos, grammatical mistakes and codes that don't work along the way. It's just frustrating to read this book if you actually repeat all the exercises."

Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 Reporting Cookbook,Dave,3.0 out of 5 stars,Frustrating read right from the start,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 30 June 2017,"The writer references items that do not exist, or leaves out details you need to figure out. They also do not explain the properties they tell you to set do. They just tell you to set them to a particular value. So, I can ""make"" the report, but because they never really explain how the pieces come together, you never really learn anything.
The instructions can be frustrating to follow.
For example on page 23, Creating Multiple Data Regions and Charts In Reports
In step 3, they tell you to select all of the fields and the name data method from the CustTable, but then never explain what the methods do. Just select it.
They then tell you ""How to Do It""
Step 1 tells you to ""Drag the CustTrans dataset to the auto design node. This will create a table design layout"" Trouble is, there is no ""CustTrans"" dataset (and they put it in bold?) There is a dataset, but they never told you what to name it. They should have written ""Drag the dataset you created above to the auto design node...""
Step 3 says, ""Drag the CustGroup field to the Group on node. Also drag the AccountNum field from the dataset to the Group on node"" Problem is, there is no ""Group On"" node to drag anything to. There is a ""Groupings"" node, which you drag the column to. THEN if you expand that, AFTER dragging the column to the Groupings node, you will see the ""Group on"" node.
Step 4 states ""Expand the Group on node and navigate to the Row1 property"" So now the Group On node IS available, however now they call the Row1 node a ""property"" so now im looking over in the properties window.
Sure, you kind of ""figure it out"" but this is the way its supposed to be when someone is teaching you something. This is only the very beginning of the book, so this can make for a long frustrating read."

"Angular 6 by Example: Get up and running with Angular by building modern real-world web apps, 3rd Edition",Nisha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Book Review - Must read for AngularJS Developers,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 7 October 2018,"Disclaimer : One of the author, Chandermani is my good friend but the whole review is unbiased and with perspective of Developer, Architect and Engineering Director.
Overall this book is a great resource to not just learn Angular but goes deeper and provides more practical usage scenarios.
Chapter 1 is truly a getting started guide, providing basics, Angular fundamentals, insights in to how updates are handled and state maintenance. It is not typical dry getting started as it weaves all this information with ""Guess the Number!"" App.
Chapter 2 covers everything a developer needs to build their first basic App ""7 Minute Workout"", setting up, code organizing, module, bootstrapping, etc. This App makes all the covered concepts interesting and relevant.
Chapter 3 introduces and prepares you for the world of SPA and Routing, this is a precursor to building the next interesting App ""Personal Trainer"" covered in Chapter 4. This App increases the complexity leveraging all the concepts.
Most application needs integration with APIs and this is covered in detail in Chapter 5. There is great amount of wisdom in Chapter 6 learning about Angular Directives, I thoroughly enjoyed this chapter.
Testing is close to my heart, and automation is a key factor for agility and innovation (fear of unknown is great demotivator to any change, lack of automation creates this fear) . Chapter 7 lays great emphasis on testing, make sure to read ""The need for automation"" section intently.
Chapter 8 wraps up this great book with practical scenarios covering performance, authentication & authorization and migrating old AngularJS app.
Both authors have done great work on making this book interesting, engaging and sharing their experiences in this book."
"Angular 6 by Example: Get up and running with Angular by building modern real-world web apps, 3rd Edition",Dude McGnarley,2.0 out of 5 stars,No exersizes - all cut n paste,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 7 July 2018,"No chapter section exercises. You're cut and pasting everything, which doesn't seem a very effective teaching methodology to me. Alternatively, what one could do is commit the configuration with both Eclipse and IntelliJ setup's and break points. Then you guide the customer through a trace and discuss points of interest like a tour guide. That would be an improvement but I would much rather have the author guiding ME to write code myself so that I encounter my own problems and get to figure them out on my own. Agree that the finished code should be available for students who get stuck, however.
One should assume that the student is a professional operating under pressure. That means they will do the bare minimum necessary to acquire MVP (Minimum Viable Product) . If you don't provide the usual cue's (section and chapter exercises) that it's time to shift from the book to the code, they might get 2, 3, or 4 chapters in and realize they aren't learning anything without grasping exactly why. It's because the lecture / read / exercise methodology is trained by public education and for someone with an extended education, they've internalized this to the point where they don't think about it any more. In a nutshell, software has standards. So does education. They are useful and exist for reasons. What the author might consider is an approach that focuses on getting the student to professional viability and then following up with a companion problem / solution guide for common things new Angular developers experience. These will quickly wind up on Stack Overflow but by the same token you can use Stack Overflow to help write the guide.
Very rough Ch / Page counts, since this is a Kindle book. Note that provided chapter page counts are handy for managing procrastination and task size perception:
1 36
2 72 *
3 78 *
4 80 *
5 36
6 48
7 46
8 70 *
* Others may feel differently but in this format, I find 70 to be way to long. Just like when you are coding, finer task granularity is better and a service to your customers."

Mastering Microsoft Power Bi: Expert techniques for effective data analytics and business intelligence,A G.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very poorly written and difficult to follow,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 3 June 2019,"Looking at the Table of Contents this appears to be a comprehensive book to help with the setting up and administering of Microsoft PowerBI. However, The content itself is very difficult to follow and key explanations of 'why' are missing. It fails to explain why one technique would be better used than another. X does this, Y does that, but not which to use and when.
It also bounces around with Chapter 1 referencing Chapter 2, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. This makes it even harder to understand.
Terms are constantly introduced with no explanation, to be frank its more lite a novel than an educational or instructive book."

The book teaches you Django by building 4 complete projects that include integration with other technologies like Redis, Celery, Memcached and multiple Python libraries and third-party Django applications.
This book does the best job covering the basics of Django and much more than that. The book is easy to follow but assumes you some basic Python and web development knowledge (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I love the examples to create a recommendation engine, a Facebook-like user activity feed and real-time async chat application using channels."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Esteban,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buen libro sobre CMake,Reviewed in Spain 🇪🇸 on 16 May 2022,"Llevo varios años usando CMake y quería darle un repaso al 'CMake moderno' para limpiar partes obsoletas de mis proyectos así que me decidí por este libro.
Es un buen libro tanto para iniciarse (3 primeros capítulos) como para profundizar en temas más avanzados de CMake. Los tres primeros capítulos abarca lo más básico para comenzar con CMake. Se ve como crear un ejecutable, una librería estática o dinámica, estructuras condicionales, presentación de opciones al usuario, trabajo con librerías de terceros, ...
El 4° capítulo va sobre como trabajar con pruebas unitarias. Me parece muy acertado que hayan incluido ejemplos para google test y boost test. También tiene otro ejemplo con Valgrind para detectar problemas de memoría. Aquí hecho de menos que no se haya incluido también Visual Leak Detector.
Lo que no me convence es que hayan dejado para el capítulo 7 la estructuración de un proyecto CMake. Personalmente creo que es de las primeras cosas que se debería explicar.
Incluye también la instalación, el empaquetado con CPack, documentación con Doxigen y Sphin, CDash.
Otro acierto del libro es utilizar en los ejemplos librerías como OpenMP, Eigen, Blas, Lapack o Boost.
Todos los ejemplos están en GitHub lo cual es de agradecer."
"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",David C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jam packed with useful information about CMake,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 7 September 2020,"The author is modest in calling this book a Cookbook. It is really so much more than that. It is a well-structured tutorial and how-to as well. The recipes build on prior recipes. Everything is explained in detail, including concepts and background about CMake. The author provides a ready-made Docker image with all the needed tools pre-installed, and a Git repository with all the book's example code. You can actually edit, build, and run the examples in the Docker image as you are reading the book. This is very helpful. I was up and running the recipes in about 10 minutes (only because I needed to install Docker on my system - otherwise it would have been 2 minutes!).
I am a professional embedded C++ developer who inherited a complex CMake build environment at work, which I need to enhance and modify. I had never been exposed to CMake before. This book is proving to be an extremely valuable resource for me, helping me to understand what I am dealing with and how to modify it."

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,GOLAK M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 January 2022,Well written book to work with robotics as the authors provided various practical examples starting from scratch
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia 🇦🇺 on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.
I recommend this book to anyone who has attempted, and even partially succeeded at, learning ROS from Google and the wiki but a thorough understanding of the system is still not quite achieved."

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Anand pL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Books for Learning Python Beginner to Advanced level,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 December 2021,"This book is an industry-level book that will help you to develop the coding skills in Python that can be used for tackling complex real-world problems that will help you to perform Automation in difficult use cases.
In this book, you’ll build on that foundational knowledge to learn how to leverage tools, libraries, and best practices to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code.
This book explains the tricks and traps that turn a few lines of Python code into much more than expected, which often leads to bugs and crashes if not written or understood correctly.
It also covers techniques for catching performance issues before they occur and debugging code efficiently when problems arise.
The content of this book is culled from code examples provided by experienced Python programmers who have encountered the same problems that you will encounter and deal with them effectively."
Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers. Suggested further reading tips are very useful and can be found at the end of each chapter. What is missing is a few questions related to developing a solution based on what is learnt in the chapter.
A very good book to read and expand your knowledge. Kudos to the author for the effort that has gone into writing the book."

Being an Electronics Graduate, I found the contents of the book extremely simple to understand and comprehend. It doesn't matter if you are not an Computer science student. The concepts of this book are extremely simple.
It covers a wide range of topics in cryptography . But some parts can have more explanations . This is not the same as the original 900+ book by Stallings . Suggested for all those who are new to cryptographt . But if you look from programming poin tof view , this book may not be sufficient . For some parts I had to refer Internet particularly regarding Elliptic Curve Cryptography , Dynamic S box etc."

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Fluff,3.0 out of 5 stars,Content is briliant. Poor index & contents listings make it very hard to use as a reference. Physical quality of book is dismal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 December 2015,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.
Note: My comments refer to Pearson New International Edition - 3rd edition ISBN-10: 1292024208, ISBN-13: 978-1292024202."
Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Ben Tristem,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Edition 3 is broken,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 11 April 2018,"Kindle Edition has serious issues where it renders mathematical symbols such as x and y as a tiny dot.

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,KENNETH MORE,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. ...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 September 2017,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. Also it refers to pages that do not contain information it claims to have. For example on page 245 it refers me to page 1066 for BNF. However if you go to page 1066 you find Bibliography. So I believe the book is incomplete as Appendixes are not included.

The content is top-notch with great visual explanations. Encoders and decoders are very hard to explain. In this book encoder and decoder chapters are peaches, they are explained with absolute perfection. The range of BERT variants in this book is mind-blowing, the book contains BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, TInyBERT, BERTSUM, etc. My favorite BERT models are XLM-R, Sentence BERT, and VideoBERT. The author explains each and every concept with ease. I personally felt very happy to have purchased and read the book. I thank the author for writing such a gem of a book. If you looking for a book to strengthen your knowledge of NLP, Deep Learning, BERT this is the go-to book. Hope my suggestion helps."

The pic shows very UNCLEAR explanation of mathematical operations. What kind of operation is shown in fig. 1.18? There are other examples like this one. I understand that pack books are not reviewed at all but this is basic presentation stuff. I expect from a book to save me time for learning. If I habe to figure out myself half of the math then I might be as better off reading some blogs online. Besides the maths there is not enough logical explanation order. It really seems that someone who really knows a lot drops some basic points but totally forgetting that he is talking (writing) to someone who knows zero about transformers."

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,ML engineer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too superficial explanations,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 4 October 2021,"Pro: The book does add a little bit of details and explanations beyond what is written in the research papers (e.g. 'Attention is all you need', 'BERT -...'). In that regard, it is not completely worthless.
Contra: However, it stays too much on the surface. It repeats itself very often (i.e. the same sentence is repeated maybe 5-10 times inside one chapter, perhaps with a non-essential reordering of the sub-sentences). There would have been many opportunities to dig deeper or provide more understanding, besides what is already written in the research papers. But the book does not do this, by and large.
So, I am back to trying to study BERT deeper using tutorials and blog posts on the internet, which are typically not satisfactory, but provide a little bit more understanding and context into understanding BERT."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Dwayne Phillips,2.0 out of 5 stars,They tried....but failed,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 26 February 2022,"I gave two stars instead of one star for effort.
(1) I bought a copy in the fall of 2021. There were printing problems with subscripts and superscripts that made the text unreadable. In addition, some of the text in the figures was tiny. I wrote the publisher and they worked with me and eventually sent me a copy of the book with the printing improved.
(2) I tried and tried and tried to get through the first 20 pages of the book. It needs to be edited and rewritten. There are basic grammar and English mistakes in every paragraph. Perhaps the writing team does not write in English as a native language. Well, that is why publishers have editors. Well, they didn't edit this book.
(3) Good effort, they tried, but they failed."

SQL for Data Analytics - Third Edition: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data,KenO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic introduction to sql & data analytics,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 15 September 2022,"This book does a great job of introducing SQL topics in a way that is intuitive and easily understood while not being frustrating in its simplicity.
I'm very new to using SQL and was stumbling through learning joins & aggregate functions when I was given the opportunity to review a pre-release copy of this book & I've gotta say that I'm unbelievably grateful for that.
Instead of struggling to make it through questionably worded online references, I have been guided through well written & intelligently motivated instruction & examples. I've learned a great deal from this book so far & I'm only about 6 chapters in.
If you're just getting started in the world of SQL, ""SQL for Data Analytics"" is an excellent guide.
Working my way through the book has given me a solid understanding of the content & has enabled me to expand beyond the examples provided & build useful queries that are already proving their worth to my team.
Highly recommended."

Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,alex3410,2.0 out of 5 stars,Info looks good but layout is poor,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 12 January 2018,"First impressions are the information is good but the formatting is really really poor - code sections have not been formatted for print so lines run on to multiple lines making it hard to read
No spacing between sections of code also make it hard to read with it all forming huge blocks of text
Finally you are presented with complete code samples explained with comments within the code rather then separate sections - these comments are not immediately obvious & again run over causing confusion as to if the text is part of the comment or code
It’s annoying because the topics complex enough as it is without struggling with poor layout
Update : finished the book, poor formatting continues throughout & makes it harder to understand the examples, writing in places is poor which again makes it harder to understand.
That being said it’s got useful information in there & worth reading if only because the number of books on CI development are slim"

Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Ola Klingberg,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite ready for printing yet.,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 12 September 2014,"This book might become worthy of three or ever four stars, once it’s finished, but this sloppily proof-read draft should not have been published. I’m at page 45, and I’m giving up now.
Both the general text and the code examples are so littered with typos and misused words that they are often difficult to make sense of.
The text reads “a single comma” when they mean “single quotes.” It says “The Boolean and contacts” when they mean “Booleans and constants.” The introduction to an example says that it “... creates a form for adding and editing a product” when in fact the example that follows is for a contact form that has nothing to do with any products.
And the code often looks like this:
function index () {
// executed when referring to My_handlercontroller via
URLecho “Hello World”; }
You have to look at that for a minute to figure out what is code and what is comment, since the lines have been muddled together.
I’m thinking about requesting a refund, even though I’ve made some highlighting. This book was simply not ready to be sent to the printer."

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",John Ferngrove,4.0 out of 5 stars,How much time do you have?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 11 June 2022,"I've docked a star from this rating because this book is not ideal for busy people who want to quickly learn the language so they can get on with their own projects. To get the best out of this book one would have to download the chapter examples, work through their code, which is much more than is presented in the text, and follow up all the links and references to documentation and dependencies which cover the entirety of the immense Python ecosystem. If I did have the time to follow up on every reference I would probably give the book five stars.
The earlier part of the book deals very well with the core language. People like myself coming to Python from earlier generation languages such as C++, Java, Tcl, etc. can quickly start messing about and muddling along according to familiar paradigms. But the real power of Python only becomes apparent when one understands the advanced data types and language constructs that make Python a genuinely next generation language. The language style that arises from a full understanding of these features is called Pythonic, and to write as such, to write Pythonically. All this makes for compact and highly readable code, of which I thoroughly approve.
As the book progresses however the explanation of the core language becomes increasingly intermixed with aspects of the broader Python ecosystem which are necessarily brief in their treatment and often too brief for the text alone to stand on its own without getting ever more involved in the example code and following up on references to a large array of third party tools and their documentation. The authors seem keen to use the opportunity to cover a career's worth of general observations and best practice heuristics on the whole field of programming more generally. All good stuff, especially for beginners, but off the point for someone wanting to master the language and get on with their own projects. I would estimate that it could take a good few months for the diligent reader to really work through the material not just of the text, but the accompanying sample programs and the documentary references as well.
There's no doubt that a beginner or a computer science student would find this a really solid underpinning to a career both in writing Python and programming more generally. If, like me, you're in a bit of a hurry to get on and apply Python to your own purposes then much of the latter half of the book could feel like a distraction. Perhaps further down the line the areas covered there will tun out to be of relevant interest. How good a reference the book will then make is hard to say. As observed, on many topics the text alone is just too brief to give a confident grounding in the material covered."
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Danilo M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Like this book as begginer,Reviewed in Germany 🇩🇪 on 5 January 2022,"Learn Python programming, for begginers and advanced users."
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.
Fairly satisfied with this book and happy with/grateful for the foundation that’s it’s helped me lay so far!"

To find two huge glaring errors in the first ten or so worked examples in what is a recap chapter of basic Tableau concepts is disconcerting on a THIRD edition of a book, and makes me doubt whether it is worth continuing with the rest of the book.
I may continue and if I get to the end and not find any further issues I may revisit this review."

Tableau is a tool - and over time popular tools will change. However, skills retain their usefulness. Aside from learning the Tableau toolset, the other reason I am interested in this book is to sharpen skills key to data science - coding, math and stats. For me, this is a practical approach - the book has loads of example solutions that I can refer to whilst problem solving."
"Mastering Tableau 2021: Implement advanced business intelligence techniques and analytics with Tableau, 3rd Edition",Julius Giron,5.0 out of 5 stars,Expert level business intelligence and visualization!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 26 August 2021,"If you are looking to up your analysis and visualization game using Tableau, this is the book for you! As a business analytics professional, I look for books that can distill complex subjects in a way that everyone can benefit from. This book does that. This book not only covers the essential functions of Tableau Software, but it also discusses advanced functionalities like expert-level examples to help with visual design, time series analysis, and geo-spatial analysis and connecting Tableau to Python and R.
Tableau is becoming more robust and flexible, allowing you now to connect Amazon Web Services (AWS)' SageMaker machine learning models to Tableau workbooks, continuing its evolution to being a complete data science platform. To better leverage Tableau, read the book."
"Mastering Tableau 2021: Implement advanced business intelligence techniques and analytics with Tableau, 3rd Edition",Native Commissioner,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle version: Navigation and Table of Contents not numbered meaningfully,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 27 March 2022,"It's difficult to see which chapter you are reading, which also makes narrowing down a search to relevant content unnecessarily convoluted. All they had to do was number the chapters visibly on the navigation. Readers are not necessarily always trying to read the entire book in sequence, publisher should make navigation efficient. Otherwise it's a pretty good intro book, but yikes you waste a lot of time just trying to narrow down a search to relevant content."
Mastering Microsoft Power Bi: Expert techniques for effective data analytics and business intelligence,gg,4.0 out of 5 stars,good book to understand on all areas of Power BI,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 20 November 2018,book gives very good scenario's on all areas of power BI.

Mastering Microsoft Power Bi: Expert techniques for effective data analytics and business intelligence,A G.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very poorly written and difficult to follow,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 3 June 2019,"Looking at the Table of Contents this appears to be a comprehensive book to help with the setting up and administering of Microsoft PowerBI. However, The content itself is very difficult to follow and key explanations of 'why' are missing. It fails to explain why one technique would be better used than another. X does this, Y does that, but not which to use and when.
It also bounces around with Chapter 1 referencing Chapter 2, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. This makes it even harder to understand.
Terms are constantly introduced with no explanation, to be frank its more lite a novel than an educational or instructive book."
Mastering Microsoft Power Bi: Expert techniques for effective data analytics and business intelligence,Gerry,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 13 January 2019,This book might have some good content but I think its terrible because you cannot follow the examples given. This is because the actual database used to create all the examples shown is a modified version of the Adventure Works DW. I see no reason why this not provided in the code files. Its fine if you just want to read it as a novel but i prefer to get my hands dirty.

Django 4 By Example - Fourth Edition: Build powerful and reliable Python web applications from scratch,Mae,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended for Python programmers,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 21 September 2022,"This book is the most practical resource to learn Django. The book teaches you Django by building 4 complete projects that include integration with other technologies like Redis, Celery, Memcached and multiple Python libraries and third-party Django applications.
This book does the best job covering the basics of Django and much more than that. The book is easy to follow but assumes you some basic Python and web development knowledge (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I love the examples to create a recommendation engine, a Facebook-like user activity feed and real-time async chat application using channels."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Esteban,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buen libro sobre CMake,Reviewed in Spain 🇪🇸 on 16 May 2022,"Llevo varios años usando CMake y quería darle un repaso al 'CMake moderno' para limpiar partes obsoletas de mis proyectos así que me decidí por este libro.
Es un buen libro tanto para iniciarse (3 primeros capítulos) como para profundizar en temas más avanzados de CMake. Los tres primeros capítulos abarca lo más básico para comenzar con CMake. Se ve como crear un ejecutable, una librería estática o dinámica, estructuras condicionales, presentación de opciones al usuario, trabajo con librerías de terceros, ...
El 4° capítulo va sobre como trabajar con pruebas unitarias. Me parece muy acertado que hayan incluido ejemplos para google test y boost test. También tiene otro ejemplo con Valgrind para detectar problemas de memoría. Aquí hecho de menos que no se haya incluido también Visual Leak Detector.
Lo que no me convence es que hayan dejado para el capítulo 7 la estructuración de un proyecto CMake. Personalmente creo que es de las primeras cosas que se debería explicar.
Incluye también la instalación, el empaquetado con CPack, documentación con Doxigen y Sphin, CDash.
Otro acierto del libro es utilizar en los ejemplos librerías como OpenMP, Eigen, Blas, Lapack o Boost.
Todos los ejemplos están en GitHub lo cual es de agradecer."
"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante."
"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Thierry B.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Moui,Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 29 August 2019,"Il n'y a pas beaucoup d'ouvrages sur CMake, et la plupart se contentent d'imprimer le manuel.
Celui-là n'a pas de grandes qualités pédagogiques et manque pas mal de recul: études de cas concrets, mais pas forcément facile de trouver des infos précises sans tout dépiauter.
Mais au moins il amène de l'info sur l'usage moderne de CMake, et reste abordable et bien écrit."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",David C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jam packed with useful information about CMake,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 7 September 2020,"The author is modest in calling this book a Cookbook. It is really so much more than that. It is a well-structured tutorial and how-to as well. The recipes build on prior recipes. Everything is explained in detail, including concepts and background about CMake. The author provides a ready-made Docker image with all the needed tools pre-installed, and a Git repository with all the book's example code. You can actually edit, build, and run the examples in the Docker image as you are reading the book. This is very helpful. I was up and running the recipes in about 10 minutes (only because I needed to install Docker on my system - otherwise it would have been 2 minutes!).
I am a professional embedded C++ developer who inherited a complex CMake build environment at work, which I need to enhance and modify. I had never been exposed to CMake before. This book is proving to be an extremely valuable resource for me, helping me to understand what I am dealing with and how to modify it."
"Hands-On Application Penetration Testing with Burp Suite: Use Burp Suite and its features to inspect, detect, and exploit security vulnerabilities in your web applications",Kiwiness,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle version missing many sections!,Reviewed in Germany 🇩🇪 on 13 January 2021,"I bought both the paperback and Kindle version of this book. The book itself is good and complete, however the Kindle version is not only missing large sections which are in the book, but there are also pages and sections completely mixed up and out of order. The Kindle version should be pulled off the market and re-edited. Otherwise the book itself is full of up to date information on Burp Suite."

Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,GOLAK M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 January 2022,Well written book to work with robotics as the authors provided various practical examples starting from scratch
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia 🇦🇺 on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.
I recommend this book to anyone who has attempted, and even partially succeeded at, learning ROS from Google and the wiki but a thorough understanding of the system is still not quite achieved."

Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Antony Vilson,2.0 out of 5 stars,This book is highly overpriced for its contents.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 13 June 2022,"It covers many things but none in detail except a few. Page quality is good, write style is great.
But highly overpriced and disappointed."
Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Anand pL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Books for Learning Python Beginner to Advanced level,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 December 2021,"This book is an industry-level book that will help you to develop the coding skills in Python that can be used for tackling complex real-world problems that will help you to perform Automation in difficult use cases.
In this book, you’ll build on that foundational knowledge to learn how to leverage tools, libraries, and best practices to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code.
This book explains the tricks and traps that turn a few lines of Python code into much more than expected, which often leads to bugs and crashes if not written or understood correctly.
It also covers techniques for catching performance issues before they occur and debugging code efficiently when problems arise.
The content of this book is culled from code examples provided by experienced Python programmers who have encountered the same problems that you will encounter and deal with them effectively."
Python for Geeks: Build production-ready applications using advanced Python concepts and industry best practices,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review of the book Python for Geeks by Muhammad Asif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 October 2021,"This book is for people who have a reasonable amount of experience in Python. In my humble opinion, it will be very helpful to people who are working in the industry as senior developers and/or architects and need to take their expertise and experience to the next level. The author has also covered topics related to the development of applications related to cloud deployment that will be very useful since most of the companies are looking for people who have the necessary expertise to develop the cloud. That said, this is one of the books that I would keep coming back to just to revise my concepts that I would have forgotten over a period of time or to gain a new perspective.
The book starts with explaining the lifecycle of a typical python project and the best practices for writing python code. It then moves on to cover more complex topics like modules and packages that are most useful to developers. A good revision of Object-Oriented Python Concepts is covered as part of chapter 3. This is one of the few books that explain how to use pytest as part of the testing framework. It also explains how to use unittest framework. This is covered as part of chapter 5 and should not be missed by the readers. Chapter 6 covers more advanced topics like building decorators and how to use data structures. For people looking to understand how to write a multi-threaded application and multi-process application, Chapter 7, covers the same. Chapter 10 and 11 will be particularly useful for readers looking to build applications using REST APIs using Flask and Micro Services using the Django framework. Chapter 12 covers building serverless functions using cloud computing and chapter 13 covers machine learning using Python.
Each chapter has a few questions that will help the reader solidify their knowledge of the chapter along with answers. Suggested further reading tips are very useful and can be found at the end of each chapter. What is missing is a few questions related to developing a solution based on what is learnt in the chapter.
A very good book to read and expand your knowledge. Kudos to the author for the effort that has gone into writing the book."

Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Fluff,3.0 out of 5 stars,Content is briliant. Poor index & contents listings make it very hard to use as a reference. Physical quality of book is dismal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 December 2015,"The content of this book is outstanding, considered by many to be the bible of AI textbooks. Incredible clarity and easy to read. Both Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell are icons of this field. Anything else I could add in this respect has already been said in countless other positive reviews.
On content alone, I would easily give the book 5 stars. However, I have three criticisms regarding issues which markedly affect the ""usability"" of the book and hence reduce the rating:
1) The ""Contents"" listing of this book is simply a list of chapter headings - each typically 2 words. In this latest edition (unlike previous ones), there is no longer a breakdown of what's in each chapter, which would help you at a glance see which chapter you need to look at for certain key topics. This is disappointing and pretty unhelpful in a text of over 1000 pages.
2) The above problem is compounded by an appallingly poor index section. Try looking up ""Neural Networks"", ""Hidden Markov Model"", ""Minimax"", ""Expectation"", ""Back propagation"", ""Utility"", etc, etc. Whilst the content of this book makes it an outstanding text to work from, its value as a reference is massively reduced given that there is no reliable way of being able to find things in it.... or in the case of a new reader ...just knowing if certain topics/items are even covered in the book. For example, given that there is no mention of ""Support Vector Machines"", ""Boosting"", or even ""Bayes"" (!) in the index (or the contents), how would an unfamiliar reader know if these were even covered by the book, let alone find them again at a later date.
3) The physical quality of this book is dismal. The cover is thin/flimsy. The pages are incredibly thin. This is not just an aesthetic issue. Lots of people who really use a text book, go back to it for many years, use post-its, write notes in it, use highlighters etc. The quality of the paper in the book affects your ability to do this. When I first received it, I thought I had been sent an Indian reprint (I checked: it's a legitimate UK copy). In fact the quality of the Pearson edition is far worse than some of the Indian reprints of other texts I've ended up with. I know there's a balance here, of not pushing the price up, and not making a long book too heavy or too thick, but this is by far the poorest quality text book on my shelves, which at the price is rather galling.
Come on Pearson, this is a popular, big-seller textbook, famous in its field. At the price you are charging for it, the quality should be better than this. At the very least, you could tackle the relatively trivial task of sorting out a half decent Table of Contents & providing a reliable index.
Note: My comments refer to Pearson New International Edition - 3rd edition ISBN-10: 1292024208, ISBN-13: 978-1292024202."
Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Ben Tristem,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Edition 3 is broken,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 11 April 2018,"Kindle Edition has serious issues where it renders mathematical symbols such as x and y as a tiny dot. This makes a hard topic nearly impossible to follow.
(I'm willing to buy the paperback instead, but would like to keep the Kindle as an searchable index)"
Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,KENNETH MORE,2.0 out of 5 stars,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. ...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 9 September 2017,The book refer to Appendixes that do not exist. Also it refers to pages that do not contain information it claims to have. For example on page 245 it refers me to page 1066 for BNF. However if you go to page 1066 you find Bibliography. So I believe the book is incomplete as Appendixes are not included.
Artificial Intelligence | Third Edition | By Pearson: A Modern Approach,Rebecca J.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 24 January 2019,The book itself is meant to be well worth reading - this review is about the packaging and quality of the item received.

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,MRS IYENGAR,5.0 out of 5 stars,A pitch-perfect book in regards to getting started with BERT in NLP.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 7 March 2021,"The amount of in-depth information compiled about BERT and its varients in this book is quite astonishing. The content is top-notch with great visual explanations. Encoders and decoders are very hard to explain. In this book encoder and decoder chapters are peaches, they are explained with absolute perfection. The range of BERT variants in this book is mind-blowing, the book contains BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, TInyBERT, BERTSUM, etc. My favorite BERT models are XLM-R, Sentence BERT, and VideoBERT. The author explains each and every concept with ease. I personally felt very happy to have purchased and read the book. I thank the author for writing such a gem of a book. If you looking for a book to strengthen your knowledge of NLP, Deep Learning, BERT this is the go-to book. Hope my suggestion helps."

I’m awestruck with the way the author have explained the concepts in a seamlessly simple way possible. I really loved the narrative style of the book.
I can’t believe someone explained BERT with so much of in-depth detail. The book covers lot of things which I was never aware of and many different types of BERT like tinyBERT, ELECTRA, Multilingual BERT, XLM-R, and many others. If you are not getting this then definitely you are missing out a greatest content on BERT ever."

The pic shows very UNCLEAR explanation of mathematical operations. What kind of operation is shown in fig. 1.18? There are other examples like this one. I understand that pack books are not reviewed at all but this is basic presentation stuff. I expect from a book to save me time for learning. If I habe to figure out myself half of the math then I might be as better off reading some blogs online. Besides the maths there is not enough logical explanation order. It really seems that someone who really knows a lot drops some basic points but totally forgetting that he is talking (writing) to someone who knows zero about transformers."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,駒井 雄一郎,1.0 out of 5 stars,It's like a student's report.

Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,ML engineer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too superficial explanations,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 4 October 2021,"Pro: The book does add a little bit of details and explanations beyond what is written in the research papers (e.g. 'Attention is all you need', 'BERT -...'). In that regard, it is not completely worthless.
Contra: However, it stays too much on the surface. It repeats itself very often (i.e. the same sentence is repeated maybe 5-10 times inside one chapter, perhaps with a non-essential reordering of the sub-sentences). There would have been many opportunities to dig deeper or provide more understanding, besides what is already written in the research papers. But the book does not do this, by and large.
So, I am back to trying to study BERT deeper using tutorials and blog posts on the internet, which are typically not satisfactory, but provide a little bit more understanding and context into understanding BERT."
Getting Started with Google BERT: Build and train state-of-the-art natural language processing models using BERT,Dwayne Phillips,2.0 out of 5 stars,They tried....but failed,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 26 February 2022,"I gave two stars instead of one star for effort.
(1) I bought a copy in the fall of 2021. There were printing problems with subscripts and superscripts that made the text unreadable. In addition, some of the text in the figures was tiny. I wrote the publisher and they worked with me and eventually sent me a copy of the book with the printing improved.
(2) I tried and tried and tried to get through the first 20 pages of the book. It needs to be edited and rewritten. There are basic grammar and English mistakes in every paragraph. Perhaps the writing team does not write in English as a native language. Well, that is why publishers have editors. Well, they didn't edit this book.
(3) Good effort, they tried, but they failed."

Charts are duplicated / missed what makes not possible to follow the examples properly.
This book can be used to get notions about the process but not not master ML with R unless you have R and stats knowledge that enables you to rewrite some code.

SQL for Data Analytics - Third Edition: Harness the power of SQL to extract insights from data,KenO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic introduction to sql & data analytics,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 15 September 2022,"This book does a great job of introducing SQL topics in a way that is intuitive and easily understood while not being frustrating in its simplicity.
I'm very new to using SQL and was stumbling through learning joins & aggregate functions when I was given the opportunity to review a pre-release copy of this book & I've gotta say that I'm unbelievably grateful for that.
Instead of struggling to make it through questionably worded online references, I have been guided through well written & intelligently motivated instruction & examples. I've learned a great deal from this book so far & I'm only about 6 chapters in.
If you're just getting started in the world of SQL, ""SQL for Data Analytics"" is an excellent guide.
Working my way through the book has given me a solid understanding of the content & has enabled me to expand beyond the examples provided & build useful queries that are already proving their worth to my team.
Highly recommended."

Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,alex3410,2.0 out of 5 stars,Info looks good but layout is poor,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 12 January 2018,"First impressions are the information is good but the formatting is really really poor - code sections have not been formatted for print so lines run on to multiple lines making it hard to read
No spacing between sections of code also make it hard to read with it all forming huge blocks of text
Finally you are presented with complete code samples explained with comments within the code rather then separate sections - these comments are not immediately obvious & again run over causing confusion as to if the text is part of the comment or code
It’s annoying because the topics complex enough as it is without struggling with poor layout
Update : finished the book, poor formatting continues throughout & makes it harder to understand the examples, writing in places is poor which again makes it harder to understand.
That being said it’s got useful information in there & worth reading if only because the number of books on CI development are slim"

Would get a refund if its possible but its been too ling since I bought.
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Ola Klingberg,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite ready for printing yet.,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 12 September 2014,"This book might become worthy of three or ever four stars, once it’s finished, but this sloppily proof-read draft should not have been published. I’m at page 45, and I’m giving up now.
Both the general text and the code examples are so littered with typos and misused words that they are often difficult to make sense of.
The text reads “a single comma” when they mean “single quotes.” It says “The Boolean and contacts” when they mean “Booleans and constants.” The introduction to an example says that it “... creates a form for adding and editing a product” when in fact the example that follows is for a contact form that has nothing to do with any products.
And the code often looks like this:
function index () {
// executed when referring to My_handlercontroller via
URLecho “Hello World”; }
You have to look at that for a minute to figure out what is code and what is comment, since the lines have been muddled together.
I’m thinking about requesting a refund, even though I’ve made some highlighting. This book was simply not ready to be sent to the printer."
Programming with CodeIgniterMVC,Eric D.

"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",John Ferngrove,4.0 out of 5 stars,How much time do you have?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 11 June 2022,"I've docked a star from this rating because this book is not ideal for busy people who want to quickly learn the language so they can get on with their own projects. To get the best out of this book one would have to download the chapter examples, work through their code, which is much more than is presented in the text, and follow up all the links and references to documentation and dependencies which cover the entirety of the immense Python ecosystem. If I did have the time to follow up on every reference I would probably give the book five stars.
The earlier part of the book deals very well with the core language. People like myself coming to Python from earlier generation languages such as C++, Java, Tcl, etc. can quickly start messing about and muddling along according to familiar paradigms. But the real power of Python only becomes apparent when one understands the advanced data types and language constructs that make Python a genuinely next generation language. The language style that arises from a full understanding of these features is called Pythonic, and to write as such, to write Pythonically. All this makes for compact and highly readable code, of which I thoroughly approve.
As the book progresses however the explanation of the core language becomes increasingly intermixed with aspects of the broader Python ecosystem which are necessarily brief in their treatment and often too brief for the text alone to stand on its own without getting ever more involved in the example code and following up on references to a large array of third party tools and their documentation. The authors seem keen to use the opportunity to cover a career's worth of general observations and best practice heuristics on the whole field of programming more generally. All good stuff, especially for beginners, but off the point for someone wanting to master the language and get on with their own projects. I would estimate that it could take a good few months for the diligent reader to really work through the material not just of the text, but the accompanying sample programs and the documentary references as well.
There's no doubt that a beginner or a computer science student would find this a really solid underpinning to a career both in writing Python and programming more generally. If, like me, you're in a bit of a hurry to get on and apply Python to your own purposes then much of the latter half of the book could feel like a distraction. Perhaps further down the line the areas covered there will tun out to be of relevant interest. How good a reference the book will then make is hard to say. As observed, on many topics the text alone is just too brief to give a confident grounding in the material covered."
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Danilo M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Like this book as begginer,Reviewed in Germany 🇩🇪 on 5 January 2022,"Learn Python programming, for begginers and advanced users."
"Learn Python Programming: An in-depth introduction to the fundamentals of Python, 3rd Edition",Maliik M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Probably best for intermediate learners. Good content overall!,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 23 August 2022,"I get the feeling that the authors of this book really, REALLY, love Python. That’s great, because their passion for the language comes through very clearly in their writing and explanation of the language and it’s features. Almost every chapter so far (I have read through chapter 8) includes some kind of Easter egg, or a very niche tip that could only be known by someone who knows the language well, so I appreciate those little details. What I don’t appreciate as much about this book is the headiness in the explanation of some of pythons core features that are often too brief to break down a topic with enough technical detail that you don’t need to turn to outside resources for more explanation. Perhaps one of the things I like the least about this book is that I am constantly being told to read the official Python documentation for explanation about topics that I assumed would have been included in the book. I don’t hold that against the authors though, because I know there’s a lot to cover and to include everything there is to know about Python would probably span multiple books. Still though, I would have preferred that some of the more basic topics where the book defers to the documentation in favor of itself would have been included and the more advanced topics had been left out instead.
With that said, so far, the biggest challenge getting through this book as a beginner has been keeping myself motivated when the reading makes such drastic shifts from difficult but approachable topics, to suddenly very dense and mathematical concepts. Because of that, this may not be the best book for an absolute beginner to read when they have no prior computer science or programming experience. I feel like I was only able to follow along because this is not my first attempt at learning a programming language and I have held onto a lot of the core principles of programming that are shared between languages like JavaScript and Python.
I think if you plan to use this book as your introduction to the Python programming language, and to programming in general, you probably need to look elsewhere to prime yourself on topics like types, variables, logical operators, and control flow before jumping in here. Those are easy to understand topics, but learning of them through this book could be inhibited by the sudden introduction of more complex topics. For example, in Chapter 2, the text goes from explaining what objects are in Python and how they are represented to a section devoted to modular exponentiation and modular multiplicative inverses and brief explanation of some other advanced topics. I have no problem with those additions to the book, but maybe not so early on, especially for the sake of not overloading beginners with such heavy information.
What I do like about the book is that, although brief on some more basic topics, and overly verbose on topics that I would consider too complex for this book, where the authors really do shine is in their detailed explanation of the core features of Python. Everything up until chapter 4 is fairly standard programming stuff with features unique to Python scattered throughout, but boy do they really go in depth about those unique features when they do come up. Chapter 5 for example is all about Comprehensions and Generators, and you’ll be practically begging for the end of the chapter to come by the time you’re halfway through the reading. Explanations on that topic, and topics like data types, functions and Python’s unique flavor of implementation go in fairly deep and you won’t leave those chapters feeling empty handed. I definitely think in that aspect, the book shines and gives you a great idea of where you might want to potentially focus your efforts when it comes to even more in depth and technical learning.
One minor pitfall about this book is that as recent as it is, it is somewhat outdated. Probably the most glaring piece of old information comes in Chapter 3, which is a very solid chapter, however the info regarding the lack of a switch case statement, which was added in Python 3.10, is incorrect. Of course this book was written for Python 3.9 so there are bound to be some minor inaccuracies here and there.
Some other nitpicks I have is that I found quite a few grammatical errors and even some issues between the code examples and what was being referenced in the text. Most of these issues were limited to Chapter 1, however I still have several more chapters to read through so I can’t speak to the whole book regarding grammar. Sometimes, the authors will use terminology that isn’t necessarily explained in the text. For example, when the book introduces functions, they reference the “caller” without really explaining what the caller is or means, and that issue arises from time to time where you might need to Google some terminology nal every now and then as you read to get caught up again. Another personal dislike is related to the author’s devotion to Pythonic and ‘elegant’ implementation of code. I don’t mind reminders here and there about good formatting, and my goodness do they hit you over the head with that PEP 8 formatting reference, but I have felt at times that there was more focus on “this type of code being better because it’s more elegant” than a true explanation of what the pros and cons of choosing between a more or less “Pythonic” approach to implementing a feature.
I went ahead and purchased the “Python Workout” book to put what I’ve learned here into practice. To that end, there are tons of code examples for you to work through ough, however most of them don’t train you to solve any real technical problems beyond providing a superficial example of what the implementation of a new topic might look like. Still though, they code examples are solid and you should work through them as you read. Just know that you’ll want to use another resource for real practice.
Overall, this is a good book for learning Python, but I would be hesitant to say it’s a great book to learn the core principles of programming AND Python. Ironically, I bought this book because I felt Meta’s 2022 backend developer course on Coursera did not go far enough explaining Python programming and it’s features in depth. Since reading this book, I feel I have a much better grasp of the concepts I’ve been learning about and feel much more prepared to start working with a framework like Django. The book past Chapter 8 covers some more advanced topics that I’m not really sure I want to focus on right now, things like APIs and GUIs, so I’m not sure if I’ll cover that part of the book anytime soon. I don’t really feel like that information is as relevant to a beginner like me, so I may come back to the book and revisit those chapters (9 - 15) in a few weeks once I get the core concepts under my belt.
Fairly satisfied with this book and happy with/grateful for the foundation that’s it’s helped me lay so far!"

"Mastering Tableau 2021: Implement advanced business intelligence techniques and analytics with Tableau, 3rd Edition",Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Riddled with errors...so far.. but fixed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 on 26 October 2021,"Update: Excellent support from Publisher who has fixed the online Tableau and will update text for next edition. Upgraded to 3 star for now. Will revisit once book finished.
I'm currently working through this book and have completed chapter 1. I'm seriously doubting continuing with further chapters due to fundamental issues with some of the material.
1. Page 37 the material uses a work alongside example to use a Measure called Quantity. The measure called Quantity does not exist.
2. Page 9, it advises to navigate to the Nested Sorting tab. Unfortunately this tab doesnt exist.
To find two huge glaring errors in the first ten or so worked examples in what is a recap chapter of basic Tableau concepts is disconcerting on a THIRD edition of a book, and makes me doubt whether it is worth continuing with the rest of the book.
I may continue and if I get to the end and not find any further issues I may revisit this review."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",Esteban,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buen libro sobre CMake,Reviewed in Spain 🇪🇸 on 16 May 2022,"Llevo varios años usando CMake y quería darle un repaso al 'CMake moderno' para limpiar partes obsoletas de mis proyectos así que me decidí por este libro.
Es un buen libro tanto para iniciarse (3 primeros capítulos) como para profundizar en temas más avanzados de CMake. Los tres primeros capítulos abarca lo más básico para comenzar con CMake. Se ve como crear un ejecutable, una librería estática o dinámica, estructuras condicionales, presentación de opciones al usuario, trabajo con librerías de terceros, ...
El 4° capítulo va sobre como trabajar con pruebas unitarias. Me parece muy acertado que hayan incluido ejemplos para google test y boost test. También tiene otro ejemplo con Valgrind para detectar problemas de memoría. Aquí hecho de menos que no se haya incluido también Visual Leak Detector.
Lo que no me convence es que hayan dejado para el capítulo 7 la estructuración de un proyecto CMake. Personalmente creo que es de las primeras cosas que se debería explicar.
Incluye también la instalación, el empaquetado con CPack, documentación con Doxigen y Sphin, CDash.
Otro acierto del libro es utilizar en los ejemplos librerías como OpenMP, Eigen, Blas, Lapack o Boost.
Todos los ejemplos están en GitHub lo cual es de agradecer."
"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",User0910,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pas mauvais, mais il existe bien mieux",Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 13 June 2021,"Le livre n'est pas vraiment un ""livre de recettes"" au sens classique, qui présupposerait une certaine connaissance de CMake. C'est bien un livre d'introduction à CMake, mais avec le parti pris d'apprendre à s'en servir en partant d'exemples complets et progressivement plus complexes, plutôt que par une introduction formelle au langage. Ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise chose, je suppose que c'est une question de goût.
Au niveau des bonnes choses, je trouve que le livre contient pas mal de recettes que l'on ne trouvera pas ailleurs, du fait de l'ouverture de l'auteur, très tôt dans le livre, à des projets multi-langages (notamment contenant du python). Sur le papier, le livre va assez loin.
Mais, au delà de l'aspect un peu rigide de la présentation imposée par Packt (Getting Ready/How to do it/How it works) qui hache et dilue le propos à mes yeux, le livres souffre de plusieurs défault. Le principal est qu'il est malheureusement déjà dépassé en 2021. CMake a évolué rapidement ces dernières années, trop pour pouvoir recommander à l'achat un livre qui semble se concentrer sur CMake 3.5 alors que CMake 3.20 vient de sortir.
Un autre défaut est que l'auteur ne semble malheureusement pas toujours de bon conseil. Non, on ne peut pas laisser traîner un CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS dans un example de son livre sans expliquer tout de suite après que c'est une mauvaise pratique à bannir dans la vraie vie. Si, il est légitime de vouloir utiliser les variables globales CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS pour contrôler les flags de compilation de tous les projets, c'est même parfois recommandable. Plus gênant, la recette pour écrire un find module repose sur les vieux mécanismes de CMake 2 en retournant des variables plutôt qu'une target.
Enfin, contrairement à ce que l'auteur laisse entendre tout au long du livre, les examples du livres sont très fortement orientés Linux, et certains ne fonctionneront tout simplement pas sous Windows avec Visual Studio. L'utilisation omniprésente de pkg-config, par exemple, est décevante."

"CMake Cookbook: Building, testing, and packaging modular software with modern CMake",David C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Jam packed with useful information about CMake,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 7 September 2020,"The author is modest in calling this book a Cookbook. It is really so much more than that. It is a well-structured tutorial and how-to as well. The recipes build on prior recipes. Everything is explained in detail, including concepts and background about CMake. The author provides a ready-made Docker image with all the needed tools pre-installed, and a Git repository with all the book's example code. You can actually edit, build, and run the examples in the Docker image as you are reading the book. This is very helpful. I was up and running the recipes in about 10 minutes (only because I needed to install Docker on my system - otherwise it would have been 2 minutes!).
I am a professional embedded C++ developer who inherited a complex CMake build environment at work, which I need to enhance and modify. I had never been exposed to CMake before. This book is proving to be an extremely valuable resource for me, helping me to understand what I am dealing with and how to modify it."
"Hands-On Application Penetration Testing with Burp Suite: Use Burp Suite and its features to inspect, detect, and exploit security vulnerabilities in your web applications",Kiwiness,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle version missing many sections!,Reviewed in Germany 🇩🇪 on 13 January 2021,"I bought both the paperback and Kindle version of this book. The book itself is good and complete, however the Kindle version is not only missing large sections which are in the book, but there are also pages and sections completely mixed up and out of order. The Kindle version should be pulled off the market and re-edited. Otherwise the book itself is full of up to date information on Burp Suite."
"Hands-On Application Penetration Testing with Burp Suite: Use Burp Suite and its features to inspect, detect, and exploit security vulnerabilities in your web applications",Noam,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken links to XVWA and OWASP make this book useless,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 7 June 2021,"This book would have been worth 5 stars had the links given to XVWA and OWASP worked.
Unfortunately, these links are broken, rendering this book useless."
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,GOLAK M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 January 2022,Well written book to work with robotics as the authors provided various practical examples starting from scratch
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Karl Mueller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Covers all the things the wiki doesn't,Reviewed in Australia 🇦🇺 on 25 July 2022,"I am very impressed with this book. I initially learned ROS through Google and the wiki. My knowledge has come a long way from just using that, and I was able to physically create, and import the model of, a robotic arm and control it to some degree, but some of the gaps in my understanding were large and I found myself stuck and looking at some quite convoluted solutions to rather simple problems that should have been able to be solved ""out of the ROS box"" had i known how all the pieces fit together.
This book fills in all those gaps. Right from the start it covers the basics and includes well-explained code examples. Certainly not for an absolute beginner, but perfect for me.
It then goes on to modelling and controlling robot arms and mobile robots. Robot arm information is difficult to find in the wiki. I prefer to use Solidworks for my modelling but the book includes enough information on importing meshes so that's not an issue.
The book also includes interfacing to remote systems, something that is incredibly useful for RPi and Arduino robots.
I recommend this book to anyone who has attempted, and even partially succeeded at, learning ROS from Google and the wiki but a thorough understanding of the system is still not quite achieved."
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,document tras technique et récent (2022) sur ROS,Reviewed in France 🇫🇷 on 5 November 2021,"Document très technique, nécessitant une bonne connaissance de linux, de python et ce C++.
Débutants, voir d'autres ouvrages plus simples. Par contre tés récent et donc utilisable avec les outils actuels."
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,Alex Escuredo Chimeno,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to follow and with examples,Reviewed in Spain 🇪🇸 on 9 November 2021,"It explains from basics of ROS to complex ones, such as navigation. Providing examples. A good guide to follow."
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,安相訓,1.0 out of 5 stars,Miserable book,Reviewed in Japan 🇯🇵 on 24 April 2022,"Fundamentals described poorly and and explanations on sample code are not enough and requests copy codes from github repo.
Unfornately, codes on github aren't executed clearly but make error and warning messages.
So, if you try to learn ROS with this material, you may waste much time to debug it with external references such as ROS wiki or youtube."
Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming: Best practices and troubleshooting solutions when working with ROS,James C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great book,Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on 30 May 2022,"The book goes over concepts well. I haven't had a lot of time to go over it in depth, but from what I have read I can recommend it."
